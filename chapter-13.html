<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 13 – THE MAGIC SWORD</div>

<p>Asahi wiped the sweat from his brow, his arms trembling under the weight of two massive boulders. The forest floor was rough beneath his feet, roots threatening to trip him at every step. Still, he forced himself onward, dragging the stones across the clearing in long, gritted-teeth strides.</p>

<p>“More! Push yourself further!”</p>

<p>I have to keep going… I can’t let my body fail me now.</p>

<p>He grunted, lifting the stones onto his shoulders again. His muscles screamed, but he forced himself to run laps around the clearing, stumbling once but catching his balance. His chest heaved, legs burning with the effort.</p>

<p>“Faster! If you can handle that, try it under attack!”</p>

<p>Focus… dodge… strike… don’t let them catch me…</p>

<p>From the shadows, a pack of lithe, jagged creatures lunged at him, their claws scraping the trunks of trees as they chased him. Asahi darted, ducked, rolled, swinging a wooden practice sword at their fleeting forms. His body ached in every joint, but he pushed on, leaping over rocks and branches with fluid determination.</p>

<p>He dropped the boulders and switched to pushups, counting each one aloud to keep his mind sharp. Pull-ups followed, his fingers white from gripping rough bark. Every fiber of his body burned with effort, yet he felt his strength slowly return and sharpen.</p>

<p>“More. You need to make your body a conductor. A weak body will leak magic like water through a sieve!”</p>

<p>I have to make every movement count… channel it all…</p>

<p>He wiped the blood and sweat from his knuckles, swinging his sword again at a target carved from a tree. Sparks of magic ran along the edge with each precise slice. The fire did not roar like before, but it struck true. His arms shook, his legs quivered, but he kept moving, kept striking, kept running, kept pushing his limits.</p>

<p>“Every movement counts! Your body channels magic! Every pull, every lift, every strike makes it sharper!”</p>

<p>Just a little more… I can feel it… the magic flowing better… stronger…</p>

<p>He ran through obstacle after obstacle, dodging imaginary monsters, lifting stones, sprinting across streams, rolling under low branches. He combined strikes, fire thrusts, and thrusts from his spear, flowing from one movement into the next. Each breath was ragged, every drop of sweat a testament to the work done. He was exhausted, bruised, and bleeding slightly, but he felt alive.</p>

<p>“Again! More! You can always push further, Asahi!”</p>

<p>This is just the beginning… I will be ready… I have to be ready…</p>

<p>By the end of the day, his body shook like a leaf in the wind, muscles quivering with exhaustion, lungs burning for air. He collapsed onto the forest floor, tasting the copper tang of his own effort, chest heaving as he looked at the sky through the leaves. Even through the fatigue, he felt it—his magic ran stronger, sharper, cleaner, flowing through sinew and bone like lightning through metal.</p>

<p>“A stronger body lets the magic flow, boy! Without it, your power will falter. Strengthen yourself, and the fire in your hands will cut the world apart!”</p>

<p>I did it… I feel it… every motion… every strike… I’m getting stronger…</p>

<p>He let the words sink in, letting his body tremble from exertion. Every day would be like this, every motion building him into someone capable of surviving, capable of winning, capable of making his magic more than just a flicker. He smiled weakly through the pain, knowing that he had taken the first step into becoming far more than he had ever been.</p>

<p>Asahi sat cross-legged on the wooden floor, still sore from the previous day’s grueling training. The witch stood before him, her hands tracing small, precise patterns in the air. Tiny sparks of color began to shimmer faintly around her fingertips.</p>

<p>“Magic is not just energy, Asahi. It is the essence of the world itself, flowing through every living thing. But it is not uniform. There are elements, and each being is born with an affinity for one.”</p>

<p>One element… so that means I can only ever hope to have fire, right?</p>

<p>“The most common are fire, water, earth, and wind. Then there are light and dark, and finally, a few rare individuals possess what we call special.”</p>

<p>The air shimmered as a small flame appeared on her palm, dancing like a miniature sun. She tilted her hand and the flame leapt into a circle, trailing sparks as it hovered in midair.</p>

<p>“Most people are born with a single element. Some have two. Very rarely, someone can wield three. Once in a century, an individual might even wield four elements simultaneously.”</p>

<p>Four elements… That seems impossible…</p>

<p>The witch’s eyes glimmered, and suddenly the flame vanished. In its place, a sphere of water swirled above her other hand, droplets dancing in patterns that seemed to defy gravity. A rough stone levitated, then a small whirlwind began spinning in the corner of the room, lifting bits of dust into an elegant spiral.</p>

<p>“Observe carefully, Asahi. Each element has its own rhythm, its own will. Mastering one is challenging enough. Imagine controlling four.”</p>

<p>Four… that’s beyond anything I could even imagine…</p>

<p>The witch clapped her hands once, and all four manifestations reacted instantly. The flame roared, the water spun violently, the earth trembled, and the wind whistled sharply through the room. They danced together in harmony for a few seconds before she dismissed them, leaving the air charged with static energy.</p>

<p>“Most will never see this in their lifetimes. Remember this, boy. Power is not measured merely by strength or the size of your magic pool. It is how you command what you have and how far you can push it.”</p>

<p>I need to get to that level… even if I start with just fire… I have to push it further…</p>

<p>The witch’s gaze softened slightly as she looked at him.</p>

<p>“You, with your little pond of magic, have already begun refining it beyond what most could hope for in a lifetime. But never forget—the world has layers of complexity. Mastery is not instantaneous.”</p>

<p>Asahi nodded, his thoughts racing with determination.</p>

<p>I’ll get there… somehow… I’ll make my fire sharper, my control tighter… I’ll show the world what I can do.</p>

<p>Asahi’s eyes widened as curiosity bubbled up.</p>

<p>“Wait… how did you heal me so fast yesterday?”</p>

<p>The witch’s lips curved slightly.</p>

<p>“That was a light magic spell. Simple, but effective.”</p>

<p>Light magic… so that’s an actual element…</p>

<p>His voice rose with a mix of awe and excitement.</p>

<p>“How many elements can you control?”</p>

<p>She tilted her head, her expression calm as ever.</p>

<p>“All of them.”</p>

<p>Asahi’s jaw dropped, his mind spinning.</p>

<p>All of them… she’s… she’s incredible…</p>

<p>“Who… who are you really?” he asked, barely able to contain his amazement.</p>

<p>The witch smiled, a small, knowing smile that made her look both kind and untouchable at the same time.</p>

<p>“Just a witch in a forest,” she said casually, as if that explained everything.</p>

<p>Just a witch in a forest… no, this is insane… I can’t believe my master is this powerful…</p>

<p>Asahi adjusted his stance, palms open and eyes focused.</p>

<p>This… this isn’t a fire thrust. I don’t need sharpness this time. Just density, just… pure form…</p>

<p>He let the flow of his life force settle into his hands, feeling it pool and thicken. A faint warmth built up, then bloomed into a tiny, steady orb of fire hovering above his palms. It wasn’t large, not more than the size of a grapefruit, but it glowed with a controlled, compact heat.</p>

<p>“Concentrate on holding it stable,” the witch instructed, her eyes scrutinizing his form. “Density is key. Shape it, feel it, and do not let it leak away.”</p>

<p>He nodded, inhaling sharply, letting the ball’s warmth pulse through his arms.</p>

<p>Small but steady… that’s enough for now… control is everything…</p>

<p>The orb didn’t flicker or sputter. It hovered perfectly, radiating a calm heat, a visible testament to the refined control he had mastered over his magic.</p>

<p>“Good. That is what control looks like. Even with a small reserve, you can make your magic precise and effective.”</p>

<p>Asahi exhaled, a small smile tugging at his lips.</p>

<p>It’s small… but it’s mine. I can feel it. I can control it. That’s the difference…</p>

<p>Asahi’s eyes widened as he tried to process everything.</p>

<p>“Then… where do I get a weapon like that? One that can properly conduct my magic?”</p>

<p>The witch stood and shuffled toward a cluttered, chaotic storage room. She muttered under her breath as she dove into piles of scrolls, odd trinkets, and stacks of dusty boxes.</p>

<p>“Hmm… somewhere here… ah, this should do.”</p>

<p>With a casual toss, she threw a sword toward Asahi. It landed perfectly in his hands. He blinked.</p>

<p>It couldn’t look more ordinary if it tried…</p>

<p>“This is the best I have right now. It will work.”</p>

<p>Asahi looked around the room, trying not to laugh at the sheer mess.</p>

<p>How does anyone find anything in here? There’s stuff stacked everywhere, like a tornado hit a junk shop… and she expects me to believe she keeps magical weapons in this chaos?</p>

<p>“Uh… thank you. I… guess this will work.”</p>

<p>The witch gave him a small, almost amused smile.</p>

<p>“It will. Don’t let appearances fool you.”</p>

<p>Asahi shook his head, still trying not to be distracted by the mountain of clutter.</p>

<p>This is insane… but I guess even messy geniuses can be scary powerful…</p>

<p>Asahi gripped the ordinary-looking sword, testing its weight and balance.</p>

<p>Whoa… this feels… perfect. Like it’s made for me.</p>

<p>“Alright… let’s see what this thing can do.”</p>

<p>The witch led him to a clearing where a few level 3 monsters lurked, unaware of the impending demonstration.</p>

<p>“Show me.”</p>

<p>Asahi focused, channeling his magic into the tip of the sword. He executed a fire thrust with pinpoint precision. The magic shot forward like a bolt of flame, piercing the chest of a direwolf effortlessly. It yelped, smoke rising, and collapsed.</p>

<p>This is insane… it just flows with my energy. I can barely feel the effort…</p>

<p>“Now a fire swing!”</p>

<p>He spun, the sword slicing through the air as a crescent of red flames followed its path. Two ogres in the clearing barely had time to react before they were scorched and staggered back, howling in pain.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous… it feels like the sword is an extension of my arm, my magic, everything… it’s so natural.</p>

<p>“Again, fire thrust.”</p>

<p>He flicked the blade forward, the flame tip scorching another monster. It crumbled before it could even think of attacking.</p>

<p>“And another swing!”</p>

<p>The magic followed his movements perfectly, creating arcs of fire that made each monster look like they were standing still in slow motion.</p>

<p>I can’t believe how easy this is. Every movement, every strike—it’s like it was made for me. I’ve never felt anything this responsive in my life…</p>

<p>He stepped back, breathing lightly but smiling ear to ear.</p>

<p>“This weapon… it’s unreal. It just… it just knows exactly what I want to do.”</p>

<p>The witch watched quietly, her expression unreadable but her eyes glinting with approval.</p>

<p>“Remember, boy, it is your skill that gives it power. But yes… it suits you perfectly.”</p>

<p>Asahi twirled the sword in his hands, eyes shining.</p>

<p>I can finally feel my magic and my strength flowing together. This… this is going to change everything.</p>
