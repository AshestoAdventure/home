<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 14 – ASAHI THE AUGMENTER</div>

<p>Asahi dragged himself up the steep hill, the massive boulder scraping against the earth. He planted his legs firmly and channeled magic into every muscle fiber in his legs, his arms lending just enough to steady the load. Sweat poured down his face, his chest heaving.</p>

<p>Focus… legs… arms… back… all of it… now!</p>

<p>“Keep going, Asahi! Don’t let it roll back!” The witch’s voice cut sharply through the air, pushing him onward.</p>

<p>The boulder teetered and slid slightly back, forcing him to redistribute the magic in his arms and shoulders. He cursed under his breath.</p>

<p>Damn it… it’s like controlling a hundred little currents at once…</p>

<p>Finally, the boulder stopped at the top of the hill. Asahi collapsed, trembling, utterly drained. His magic pool nearly empty.</p>

<p>Over the next month, the training repeated in endless, grueling variations. Pushups, pull-ups, swinging weighted logs, running up slopes while carrying stones, climbing trees, balancing along branches, and sprinting from fast-moving magical predators the witch conjured. Each time, he augmented the limbs and muscles relevant to the task, trying to keep control over the flow of energy.</p>

<p>Legs for speed, arms for swings, core for stability… okay, this time I won’t fall…</p>

<p>Despite his careful concentration, he often misjudged the flow of magic. Fire swings that went wide, spear throws that fizzled midair, leaps that fell short. A couple of times, monstrous illusions of level three creatures appeared, and Asahi faltered, running out of magical stamina. Each time, the witch appeared like a ghost, saving him with minimal effort but with a sharp reprimand.</p>

<p>“You must sense your limits before overextending!” she yelled once after catching him mid-fall from a tree branch.</p>

<p>He groaned, sitting on the ground, panting and bruised.</p>

<p>I’m supposed to be refining efficiency, but I blacked out again…</p>

<p>On several days, the exhaustion went beyond simple fatigue. His vision blurred, magic dissipated entirely, and he fell unconscious for minutes at a time. The witch would hover over him silently, waiting until his body rebalanced itself.</p>

<p>“Again, Asahi. Learn to conserve your energy. Your body must obey without draining the source entirely.”</p>

<p>Each session blended physical torment with magical finesse. He learned to anticipate muscle fatigue and adjust augmentation accordingly. His arms burned during swings, his legs trembled during climbs, yet slowly, painfully, he grew stronger. He could feel each swing, each step, each jump conduct magic efficiently.</p>

<p>Maybe… just maybe… I can finally control this…</p>

<p>By the end of the month, despite bruises, exhaustion, and countless blackouts, Asahi had trained every inch of his body under augmented magic. Every fiber knew the sensation of energy flowing perfectly in concert with his movements. He still ran out of magic sometimes, still blacked out occasionally, and still struggled against even moderate monsters, but now there was a glimmer of mastery.</p>

<p>The witch observed quietly, her expression a mixture of pride and exasperation.</p>

<p>“One month, and yet you are only beginning to grasp it. Control is never simple. You must continue beyond what your body screams at you.”</p>

<p>Asahi lay on the ground, staring at the sky, breathing heavily, bloodied and battered, but with a faint, determined smile forming on his lips.</p>

<p>I won’t fail next time… I must be ready.</p>

<p>The witch’s eyes narrowed as she surveyed Asahi, who was still catching his breath from the previous exercise.</p>

<p>“You have learned enough for now. Just enough to barely pass as an augmenter. But don’t mistake that for mastery. Your next stage will test not only your strength but your survival instinct. You will enter the fourth layer. There, the monsters will not forgive mistakes.”</p>

<p>Asahi sat up, his body trembling from the last month’s rigorous training.</p>

<p>Fourth layer… That’s the layer she mentioned… I’ll need every ounce of control and magic to survive there…</p>

<p>“Level four is a different world entirely,” she continued, pacing slowly. “You will face monsters far stronger than ogres or werewolves. Colossal manticores, venomous wyverns with wingspans that blot out the sky, stone-scaled drakes, shadow fiends, and other creatures that can crush a seasoned adventurer with a single strike. Each encounter will push your augmentation and your magic reserves to the limit. Remember, you will likely black out, and I will save you when necessary, but you must fight for your life each time. Every mistake could be your last.”</p>

<p>Asahi clenched his fists, trying to steady his racing heartbeat.</p>

<p>Alright… I survived level three… I’ve grown… I can do this. Level four… I have to survive.</p>

<p>For the next month, he dove headfirst into life-and-death battles against these much more dangerous level four creatures. Venomous wyverns lunged from the trees with talons capable of piercing armor, colossal manticores stalked him through the dense foliage, shadow fiends melted through the underbrush with eerie speed, and stone-scaled drakes charged with overwhelming force. Each fight was brutal, testing his timing, magic control, and strategic thinking like never before.</p>

<p>He augmented his body with precision, infusing his legs for explosive jumps and his arms for sharper strikes. Timing his fire thrusts and swings was now critical—one wasted ounce of magic could be fatal. The witch appeared at the last possible moment whenever he blacked out, yanking him from death with sharp reprimands.</p>

<p>“Do not waste magic on sloppy movements! Do not die out of pride!” she yelled once after saving him from a manticore strike that had pinned him mid-leap.</p>

<p>Asahi groaned, sitting against a tree, bleeding and covered in scratches.</p>

<p>I can’t let myself die. Every battle is a lesson. Every monster teaches me something… I have to survive.</p>

<p>He experimented with spear throws and fire thrusts, blending them with fire swings from his sword. Each encounter forced him to adapt, refine his magic, and learn the nuances of augmented combat. He blacked out multiple times, sometimes for long stretches, and the witch always pulled him back just in time. Every awakening left him sore, exhausted, but slightly sharper, slightly more capable.</p>

<p>I am stronger… but level four monsters are merciless… I still have a long way to go.</p>

<p>By the end of the month, Asahi could handle multiple level four monsters in succession, though he was far from perfect. He had learned to conserve magic, strike with precision, and survive under extreme pressure. Fire thrusts and swings were now executed with more control, and his augmentation technique was far more reliable, though still draining.</p>

<p>“You have survived the fourth layer for a month,” the witch finally said, her voice approving yet cautious. “You are no longer a child who flails blindly. You may now fight as an augmenter who can survive in level four. True strength is not raw power alone—it is knowing yourself, your limits, and your magic.”</p>

<p>Asahi wiped the sweat and blood from his face, a faint grin forming despite the aches.</p>

<p>I can survive level four… I can do this… next time I’ll be even stronger…</p>

<p>The forest around him was quiet for the moment, but shadows hinted at dangers still lurking, always testing him, always forcing him to grow.</p>

<p>The witch’s eyes gleamed with quiet intensity as she faced Asahi.</p>

<p>“Today,” she said, her voice clear and firm, “you will have a rematch against an Obsidian Widow. Do not be fooled—she is of the same strength and speed as the one you fought before. This is a fresh creature, conjured for you to test everything you have learned.”</p>

<p>Asahi’s heart thudded. The memory of the previous fight—the one that had nearly ended him—flashed in his mind. Every scar, every swing, every ounce of magic he had used came rushing back.</p>

<p>It’s a new one… but it’s just as deadly. I’ve grown… I know I’ve grown… I can do this…</p>

<p>The witch’s gaze sharpened. “You will not have my intervention this time. You must rely on your augmentation, your timing, your judgment. Anticipate, strike, and survive. Treat her as you would a real threat, because she is.”</p>

<p>Asahi flexed his fingers around his sword hilt, adjusted his spear on his back, and felt the familiar tingling of readiness through his body.</p>

<p>All the training, all the months of pushing myself… it all comes down to this moment. No holding back.</p>

<p>He lifted his head, a determined smirk forming. “Bring it.”</p>

<p>The witch inclined her head slightly, a mixture of curiosity and approval in her eyes. “Then go. Show me how far your little pond has come when the water finally runs clear.”</p>
