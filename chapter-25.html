<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 25 – COMBAT THEORY</div>

<p>The next morning Asahi blinked awake and rubbed his eyes. A stray thought hit him like a stone. Combat Theory. His first real class. A mix of nerves and excitement twisted in his chest. He stretched, got dressed, and made his way to the dining hall.</p>

<p>As always, the moment he stepped in the atmosphere shifted. Heads turned, whispers started, and eyes lingered on him. He didn't even bother reacting this time. Guess I'm getting used to this sideshow, he thought, heading for one of the tables.</p>

<p>At every seat was a blank, glassy board. Asahi pressed his palm against it, let a little mana seep in, and the surface shimmered to life. Instantly dozens of meals scrolled across the glowing panel — elegant dishes, steaming soups, roasted meats, desserts that looked stolen from a king's banquet. He tapped on something simple, and with a flash, the plate appeared in front of him, perfectly hot.</p>

<p>A moment later, Akari entered, graceful as ever, and selected her meal with a casual touch. She joined him without asking. Sasaki arrived right after, glancing nervously around before sliding into the seat across from Asahi. His board lit up with a faint glow, and he hesitated before choosing, as if even ordering food in front of others made him self-conscious.</p>

<p>"Good morning," Asahi said, smirking slightly at the contrast between them.</p>

<p>"Morning," Akari replied, cutting straight into her meal.</p>

<p>Sasaki cleared his throat and glanced up. "So… Combat Theory is today, right? You'll do great, Big Bro." His voice dropped a little on the last words, almost shy, before he quickly stabbed at his food.</p>

<p>Asahi raised an eyebrow, amused. This guy's one of the top tens, yet in public he acts like he's sneaking glances at a crush. Unbelievable.</p>

<p>Asahi tapped the glowing board with a touch of magic, selecting a steaming breakfast dish that appeared instantly before him. He had gotten used to the strange stares that followed him around the dining hall by now. Sitting down, he found Sasaki and Akari already waiting for him.</p>

<p>Between bites he suddenly asked, "Hey, how did you even know I had combat classes today?"</p>

<p>Both Sasaki and Akari looked at him as if he had asked the most obvious question in the world.</p>

<p>Sasaki tilted his head. "Big Bro… we are all first years. You may have joined halfway through, but the schedule is the same for every first year."</p>

<p>Akari smiled as she added, "Exactly. We all share the same classes this year."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. "So what are the subjects then?"</p>

<p>Sasaki perked up, eager to explain. "We have three main ones. Principles of Combat Theory, Martial Applications and Strategy, and Arcane Foundations. Everyone has to take them."</p>

<p>Asahi leaned back, digesting the information. "I see… wait, then what about Kenzo and Ryunosuke? What year are they?"</p>

<p>"They are third years," Akari replied casually.</p>

<p>The words hit Asahi like a jolt. He froze, eyes wide. "What? Third years? And I managed to hold my ground against Kenzo?"</p>

<p>Sasaki grinned nervously, rubbing the back of his neck. "That is why you are getting so much attention, Big Bro. A first year beating a top five… that has never happened before."</p>

<p>Akari gave a soft laugh, her tone both amused and impressed. "Unprecedented is the word. No one can stop talking about it."</p>

<p>Asahi sat quietly for a moment, still stunned, then thought to himself, These two… Akari and Sasaki… they are also incredible. First years already counted among the top ten. Just how many monsters are there in this academy?</p>

<p>By the time they left the hall and started walking toward the classrooms, whispers and stares followed them every step of the way. Students along the corridor parted just enough to watch in silence as the trio passed: the boy who had stood against Kenzo, flanked by two of the academy's top ten. It was as if the very air around them had shifted, heavier with the pressure of expectation.</p>

<p>Asahi sighed inwardly, already used to the weight of eyes on him, but he could not help thinking, This is only the beginning.</p>

<p>Asahi, Sasaki, and Akari made their way down the corridor, the quiet murmur of onlookers trailing behind them. The whispers were starting to blend into background noise for Asahi when suddenly, a figure stepped in front of them, blocking the way.</p>

<p>A tall redhead stood with arms crossed, eyes burning with the same fiery color as his hair. His stance was casual, but the aura he gave off was anything but.</p>

<p>Asahi stopped in his tracks, blinking. "...Really? Another redhead?" he muttered under his breath, glancing briefly at Akari before focusing on the boy in front of them.</p>

<p>Sasaki immediately stiffened beside him, whispering nervously, "Big Bro… that's Renji."</p>

<p>The name rippled through the crowd like a spark. Students who had been quietly trailing them now leaned closer, excitement flaring. Even Akari's expression shifted from her usual smug calm to something more serious.</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head slightly, thinking, Great. Just what I needed. Breakfast hasn't even settled, and now this guy's showing up with the 'main character entrance' pose.</p>

<p>Renji's lips curved into a faint smirk as his eyes locked onto Asahi. "So you're the one who defeated Kenzo."</p>

<p>The corridor went completely still.</p>

<p>On the outside, Asahi kept his posture calm, shoulders squared and chin lifted just enough to look confident. "Yes," he said evenly. "That's right."</p>

<p>On the inside, though, his brain was screaming. Why do all these dramatic types show up blocking hallways? Is this some sort of school tradition? What's next, a theme song and backup dancers?</p>

<p>Renji's eyes narrowed slightly, studying him like a hawk sizing up its prey. The silence dragged, the tension thick.</p>

<p>Don't flinch, Asahi. Look cool. Cool and composed. Even though this guy looks like he walked straight out of a flame-themed manga cover.</p>

<p>Sasaki was practically trembling beside him. "Big Bro…" he whispered, clutching his book tighter.</p>

<p>Asahi gave the faintest nod, still locked on Renji, but his inner thoughts kept rolling. Okay, here we go again. Another one of the 'top something' characters. Can't a guy just go to class without fighting the next big boss on the roster?</p>

<p>Renji's smirk widened, and he leaned slightly closer, eyes flicking over Asahi. "Huh… I don't see anything special about you."</p>

<p>Asahi's composed exterior didn't falter, but inside he was thinking, Well, that's… not exactly flattering. And he said it like he's giving a review on a menu item.</p>

<p>Before Asahi could even respond, Akari stepped in between them, arms crossed and gaze sharp. "Renji, back off. There's no need to bother him."</p>

<p>Renji chuckled, leaning back just enough to give her a teasing glare. "Hah, hiding behind girls now, huh? Be careful, or else…"</p>

<p>With a final smirk at Asahi, he turned and walked away, his long strides eating up the corridor as he disappeared around the corner.</p>

<p>Asahi exhaled quietly, lowering his shoulders. Well, that was… intense. Why is it always redheads? And why do they always have to act like they're auditioning for the main villain?</p>

<p>Sasaki, still a few steps behind, muttered nervously, "Big Bro… that was kind of scary."</p>

<p>Asahi glanced after Renji, still processing the encounter. "Wait… who exactly was that guy?"</p>

<p>Sasaki shuffled nervously beside him. "That was Renji Boleyn. He's… um… the only second year currently in the top five. And he's…" He trailed off, glancing quickly at Akari.</p>

<p>Akari's gaze dropped, her hand brushing along her arm. After a moment of hesitation, she finally spoke quietly, almost to herself. "He's my half brother."</p>

<p>Asahi froze for a moment, blinking. …Wait, seriously? The redhead was your half brother? Well, that explains the theatrics… and the hair color.</p>

<p>Sasaki looked relieved that she had said it herself. "Yeah… that's why he's so intense. Everyone's a little on edge when he's around."</p>

<p>Asahi let out a slow breath, shaking his head slightly. First Kenzo and Ryunosuke, now Renji… this school is really full of surprises.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes flicked between Sasaki and Akari, his mind racing. Wait… I thought Akari was a commoner, but Renji is clearly noble. She just said half brother… and she also said earlier that her situation was complicated.</p>

<p>A slow realization hit him. She's probably the bastard child of a nobleman. That's why she can't use the family name but still has ties to the noble house. That explains a lot… including why she's so strong and composed.</p>

<p>He exhaled quietly, shaking his head. Wow… this school really isn't simple. Every person seems to carry a dozen hidden stories.</p>

<p>Sasaki, sensing his contemplative silence, whispered, "Big Bro… don't overthink it."</p>

<p>Asahi smirked faintly, thinking, Yeah, easier said than done when half the school is secretly a mess of nobles, top students, and hidden powers.</p>

<p>The trio entered the classroom, which had a surprisingly orderly atmosphere compared to the combat room from before. Instead of individual desks, the room had long wooden tables with matching benches, neatly lined up in rows. Sunlight streamed through tall windows, casting warm light across the polished floor. Along the walls, shelves were filled with books on strategy, weapon techniques, and magical theory, and a large blackboard at the front displayed diagrams of formations, stances, and energy flow charts.</p>

<p>Asahi led the way, glancing around. Huh… this feels almost like a normal school classroom. I was expecting another battlefield.</p>

<p>Sasaki followed, whispering under his breath about how pristine and organized everything looked. Akari stayed behind them, calm as ever, scanning the room with an unreadable expression.</p>

<p>They chose a spot in the middle right section, a good vantage point to see both the blackboard and the teacher's area. Sitting down on the bench, Asahi leaned back slightly, watching the other students quietly filing in. Their glances were curious, some even skeptical, but he had learned to ignore that by now. I'm used to it.</p>

<p>Sasaki adjusted his posture on the bench, trying to act composed but still stiff with nervous energy. Akari sat beside them, perfect posture, exuding calm authority. Asahi smirked faintly. At least this class doesn't involve weapons flying at my head… yet.</p>

<p>The classroom settled into quiet murmurs as the students took their places at the long tables, setting the stage for Asahi's first combat theory lesson.</p>

<p>As the students were settling in, the door at the front of the classroom opened with a quiet authority. In stepped none other than the headmaster herself. Asahi froze for a moment, his eyes widening in surprise. She's teaching this class? I didn't expect that at all.</p>

<p>Akari leaned slightly toward him, her voice calm. "The headmaster insists on teaching a few subjects herself. No one objects… she's one of the top five magic users currently alive."</p>

<p>Asahi swallowed, still trying to process it. Top five… she could probably wipe out this entire classroom without even trying.</p>

<p>The headmaster's gaze swept across the room, settling briefly on Asahi before she spoke. "Good morning, everyone. Today we're going to discuss advanced tactical deployment of elemental energies in close combat scenarios. Specifically, we will examine integrating elemental manipulation with weapon strikes to maximize efficiency and control over the battlefield."</p>

<p>A ripple of excitement ran through the students. Even those used to high-level combat were attentive. The headmaster's reputation wasn't just for show.</p>

<p>Asahi's mind raced. So this is why the combat theory class exists… it's not just swinging swords, it's controlling every aspect of an encounter. This is going to be intense.</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, letting her words sink in, then continued, "We'll start by analyzing the interplay between fire and wind when striking multiple opponents, how to maintain offensive momentum while conserving magical reserves, and the positional advantages of elemental bursts in confined spaces."</p>

<p>Even from the middle right of the classroom, Asahi could feel the weight of her presence. He glanced at Sasaki and Akari. Sasaki looked simultaneously nervous and awestruck, while Akari simply nodded, perfectly composed as always.</p>

<p>Asahi thought to himself, This is going to be a lesson I'll never forget. I just hope I can keep up… and not embarrass myself in front of everyone.</p>
