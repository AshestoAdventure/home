<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 9 – DEADLY TRAINING</div>

<p>The forest was darker here. The air itself felt heavier, as if the trees had grown too close together just to choke out the light. This was no longer the realm of goblins and kobolds. The monsters lurking here were bigger, smarter, and far deadlier. Asahi's breathing was steady, his steps controlled. The training had made him sharp, his movements almost soundless now. He wasn't clumsy anymore. He was a hunter.</p>

<p>His Fire Thrust Spear had grown more fluid, the swings cleaner. But his efficiency had plateaued at 60 percent, and that number itched at the back of his mind every time he fought. The forest wasn't going to give him easy prey anymore. It was going to test him. And it did.</p>

<p>The first time he saw them, he froze for a heartbeat. Hobgoblins. Taller than men, muscles packed onto their hulking frames, jagged weapons in hand. Three of them. They were arguing over some carcass before they noticed him, but when their yellow eyes locked on his figure, a guttural roar shook the air.</p>

<p>"Tch… here they come."</p>

<p>He planted his foot, his body twisting as his spear lit up in flames. The nearest hobgoblin swung its crude axe. He slid under it, flames bursting outward in a sharp swing. The fire carved across its chest, but it didn't fall. Its scream rattled the leaves.</p>

<p>His thoughts cut through the clash of metal.</p>

<p>Too tough. I need precision. Wide swings won't bring them down fast enough.</p>

<p>Another hobgoblin lunged, spear aimed at his ribs. He barely twisted away, sparks scraping his side as it grazed his armor. He grit his teeth. His fire swing came out again, this time tighter, sharper. The blaze scorched two at once. The first collapsed, shrieking. The second stumbled back, its skin charred. Asahi's heart pounded with the rhythm of battle, but his strikes were growing cleaner. More refined.</p>

<p>Over the weeks that followed, it became a cycle of blood, fire, and breathless nights. Hobgoblins gave way to direwolves, their snarls echoing between the trees. They hunted in packs, forcing him to anticipate, to move with instinct rather than hesitation. His spear was no longer just a weapon. It was an extension of his body.</p>

<p>"Come on then!" His voice cracked with adrenaline as he spun, launching his spear into the throat of a charging wolf. The beast dropped instantly, blood steaming in the heat of his flames. He didn't pause. His other hand had already drawn his sword, slashing across the flank of another wolf that leapt at him from the side. His mind sharpened in those fights.</p>

<p>Keep moving. Never stop moving. Their strength is numbers. Mine is fire. Mine is speed.</p>

<p>He began eating what he killed, roasting direwolf meat over makeshift fires, chewing through charred flesh just to keep himself standing. Sleep came in short bursts. His body healed in patches, covered in bandages of rough cloth. And yet every fight pushed him further. 70 percent. 80 percent. 90. His body was learning, adapting faster than his mind could track.</p>

<p>Then came the ogres. Brutish, towering monsters whose steps made the ground tremble. His first clash nearly killed him. One swing of its club shattered trees, the shockwave blasting him off his feet. He scrambled up, blood dripping from his forehead, ribs screaming. The ogre roared, raising its weapon again.</p>

<p>I can't block that. I'll die if I try. I need to strike faster than its swing. Think, Asahi. Think.</p>

<p>He dove in close, spear blazing. Fire Thrust Spear launched at its thigh, piercing deep. The ogre howled, its club crashing down just inches from where he rolled. The fight stretched on for what felt like hours. He stabbed, he dodged, he bled. Finally, with a desperate cry, he hurled his spear at its head. The flames drilled straight through its skull. The giant toppled, shaking the forest floor.</p>

<p>Asahi collapsed beside it, chest heaving.</p>

<p>"Damn… that almost broke me."</p>

<p>Nights passed with nothing but the crackle of fire and his own ragged breathing for company. He would wake sore, bruised, but alive. Every scar pushed his efficiency higher. 95 percent. His attacks became instinct. His blade never hesitated. The sword in his other hand began finding its own rhythm, clashing in unison with the spear.</p>

<p>The wolves came again. This time werewolves, grotesque hybrids of man and beast, faster and stronger than any wolf before them. The first one nearly ripped his arm apart, but his double grip held it back, fire licking its fur. His eyes widened.</p>

<p>Both blades… both at once. Not separate. Together.</p>

<p>He moved with sudden clarity. The spear came low, sweeping flames across its legs. The sword slashed high, searing through its chest. For the first time, both weapons sang together, the fire blazing in harmony. The beast collapsed in smoking pieces.</p>

<p>"Double Sword Swing…" he whispered, the name forming naturally as he stared at his burning blades. "Finally."</p>

<p>The days that followed cemented it. Each fight polished the move until it was flawless. A full hundred percent. His strikes were no longer sloppy experiments but perfected forms. Fire carved arcs of destruction, wolves howled their last breaths, ogres fell to his relentless rhythm.</p>

<p>Weeks passed in blood and fire. His body bore the cost—scars, exhaustion, hunger—but his spirit was iron. He had entered this part of the forest as prey. Now, standing among the ashes and bones of monsters, Asahi was something else entirely. A predator sharper than the creatures he fought. And for the first time in weeks, he allowed himself to sit beneath a tree, spear and sword resting at his side, and whispered into the quiet night.</p>

<p>"One hundred percent. At last."</p>

<div class="narrator">What Asahi failed to realize was the absurdity of his progress. To push efficiency even beyond fifty percent was a feat that most adventurers would consider remarkable, a plateau that many never passed in their entire lives. Yet here he was, climbing steadily toward perfection through nothing but instinct, stubbornness, and desperation. Every swing refined itself, every thrust carried purpose. And though he cursed his weakness and berated himself after every battle, the truth was terrifying: Asahi was on the cusp of something extraordinary. Few in this world had ever touched one hundred percent efficiency. Fewer still had survived long enough to wield it. And he, a boy who believed himself to be frail and unworthy, was walking straight into legend without even realizing it.</div>

<p>The days of struggle faded into a stretch of uneasy calm. For the first time since entering the forest, Asahi allowed himself to rest. He lay beside the stream for hours, sword balanced across his lap, staring at the sky as if it owed him answers. His wounds had healed, his movements were smoother than ever, and the weight of battle seemed to have dulled.</p>

<p>"Heh… guess I really am getting stronger."</p>

<p>The thought lingered, dangerous and sweet. Each roasted meal, each hour of uninterrupted sleep, only fed his pride. He tested his swings by the water's edge, crimson flames slicing the air in crescents that burned bright, sharp, and perfect. His efficiency was no longer a number he measured in doubt. He felt it now. He owned it.</p>

<p>When he finally rose, his spear strapped to his back and his polished sword gleaming at his side, there was no hesitation. He marched deeper north, where the trees grew darker, the air thicker, and the growls of creatures shook the earth.</p>

<p>The first ogre came at dusk, its massive body blotting out the fading light, muscles rippling as it raised a club bigger than Asahi himself. A month ago, he would have frozen. Now, he smirked.</p>

<p>"Perfect test."</p>

<p>The club came down with a thunderous crash, shaking the ground. Asahi's body flowed sideways, smooth as water. His blade lit up, flames bursting along its edge. One swing. A blazing crescent tore through the ogre's side, searing flesh and dropping the beast with a guttural roar.</p>

<p>Another came, bellowing, charging through the trees like a living avalanche. Asahi's eyes narrowed. His spear spun in his hands, magic humming at the tip.</p>

<p>"Fire Thrust!"</p>

<p>The spear left his grasp, gliding with perfect precision, a streak of red cutting through the night. It pierced the ogre's chest, flames bursting outward, the smell of burning flesh filling the air. The monster collapsed, its club tumbling uselessly to the ground.</p>

<p>Asahi pulled his spear free, chest heaving, but his grin never faltered.</p>

<p>"This is nothing. I can do this all day."</p>

<p>More monsters followed—hulking trolls with jagged teeth, horned beasts that charged with murderous intent. Each time, Asahi moved faster, struck cleaner, his flames sharper and deadlier. He cut through them like they were training dummies, every kill feeding the fire of his confidence.</p>

<p>When he finally sat down, bloodied but triumphant, he leaned against a shattered tree and laughed.</p>

<p>"So this is one hundred percent. I'm unstoppable."</p>

<p>But in the silent darkness of Ironfang Woods, the trees whispered of dangers that dwarfed ogres and trolls. And Asahi, basking in his victory, had no idea just how deep the abyss before him truly was.</p>

<p>The morning air was crisp as Asahi trekked further north, his boots crunching over fallen leaves, his sword swaying lightly at his side. His body felt stronger than ever, and his mind wandered freely for the first time in months.</p>

<p>"If I keep heading north, I've got to reach a city sooner or later," he thought, brushing aside low branches. "I wonder what it'll look like. Big walls? Merchants shouting in the streets? Maybe even an adventurer's guild…" A grin tugged at his lips. "Yeah, that'd be perfect. Finally, I can take real quests instead of chasing goblins and ogres for breakfast."</p>

<p>He imagined taverns with warm food, bustling markets, and a bed softer than the mossy roots he had grown used to. For the first time in a while, hope colored his thoughts.</p>

<p>But the forest had a way of punishing daydreams.</p>

<p>A sharp click-click-click echoed from above. The sound froze him in his tracks. His eyes darted upward, scanning the canopy. Then he saw it. Those long, spindly legs moving across the branches, the glint of dark chitin, the slow, deliberate crawl. His chest tightened.</p>

<p>"…You've got to be kidding me."</p>

<p>The spider. The very same type that had nearly devoured him months ago when he was nothing but a trembling, desperate boy with only a wooden practice sword.</p>

<p>Its fangs glistened with venom, mandibles twitching as it fixed those many black eyes on him. The creature was larger than he remembered or maybe he was just close enough now to see it in all its terrifying detail.</p>

<p>Asahi's grip tightened around his sword hilt. His heart hammered, not out of fear this time, but from the weight of memory crashing back. The cold paralysis. The sticky webs. The hopelessness.</p>

<p>"Not again," he whispered, fire sparking along the edge of his blade. "This time… I'm ready."</p>
