<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 34 – ASAHI VS THE STRONGEST</div>

<p>The air in the duel room was thick with smoke and mana residue. Flames still danced on the cracked floor, and wisps of lightning arced across shattered tiles. Ryunosuke and Rensuke stood a few meters apart, both breathing hard, surrounded by the aftermath of their storm. Then, after a long silence, Rensuke exhaled and lowered his hand.</p>

<p>"It's your win again, cousin," he said with a faint grin, brushing soot off his cloak. His voice was calm, but there was no bitterness—only acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The crowd erupted into murmurs and whispers, some cheering, others too stunned to speak. Ryunosuke gave a casual shrug, his usual cool confidence unshaken. "You've improved," he said, his voice steady despite the exhaustion flickering behind his eyes. "That last spell almost broke through."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, still in awe. "Wait, that's it? Why'd they stop? Neither of them even looked close to losing."</p>

<p>Akari turned to him with a small smirk. "You really don't get mage battles, do you? It's not about who's standing—it's about who still has mana to burn."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded, pushing up his glasses. "Exactly. When two mages of that level fight, they measure each other's reserves with every spell. If one keeps pushing while nearly empty, it could be fatal. My guess? Rensuke's running low. One more big spell and he'd collapse."</p>

<p>Asahi crossed his arms, frowning. "So it's basically a fancy staring contest… with explosions?"</p>

<p>Akari chuckled. "More like a death match where the first to run out of fuel loses the right to live. You waste mana, you die."</p>

<p>Asahi whistled softly, eyes back on the two cousins as they exchanged a respectful nod. Inside, he couldn't help thinking, Running out of magic, huh? Guess I'd last… about six seconds in there.</p>

<p>Sasaki stifled a laugh beside him. "Don't worry, big bro. You make up for it with your absurd augmentation. If you fought either of them, it'd be your muscles doing the talking, not your mana."</p>

<p>Asahi gave him a look. "That's… comforting. In a suicidal sort of way."</p>

<p>The crowd began to disperse, but the energy in the room lingered like smoke after a fire—thick, heavy, and unforgettable.</p>

<p>As the cheers faded and the crowd began to thin, only a handful of students remained—those who couldn't tear their eyes away from what they'd just witnessed. The air still shimmered faintly with leftover mana, the ground scorched and cracked from countless spells. Ryunosuke and Rensuke stood side by side now, speaking quietly, their rivalry momentarily set aside.</p>

<p>Asahi's group lingered near the back, not wanting to intrude but too fascinated to leave. Sasaki was still muttering about mana efficiency, while Akari had that glint in her eyes—the kind she got when studying powerful opponents.</p>

<p>But then Asahi's gaze drifted to the far corner of the hall. There, leaning against a pillar with arms crossed, was Kenzo. His sharp eyes hadn't missed a single second of the duel. Around him stood a handful of commoner students, his loyal group, each one watching with silent intensity.</p>

<p>Asahi felt their eyes flick briefly toward him before returning to Ryunosuke. A small smirk crossed Kenzo's face—one of those unreadable ones that could mean challenge accepted or I'm already planning something.</p>

<p>Asahi sighed inwardly. Of course he's here. Where there's power, there's Kenzo.</p>

<p>Sasaki followed his line of sight and whispered, "Ah, looks like your old rival's been watching too."</p>

<p>"Rival?" Asahi muttered, scratching his head. "Pretty sure I barely survived the last time we fought."</p>

<p>Akari folded her arms. "Well, he's been watching you since then. I'd say he sees you differently now."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. "Differently as in 'potential ally,' or 'target to crush later'?"</p>

<p>"Knowing Kenzo," Akari said with a sly grin, "probably both."</p>

<p>The tension in the room thickened again, though no one said another word. Ryunosuke's group, Kenzo's group, and Asahi's—three factions quietly sizing each other up under the cracked lights of the dueling hall.</p>

<p>And deep down, Asahi could already feel it.</p>

<p>The real battles of the tournament hadn't even begun yet—but the sparks had already started flying.</p>

<p>Asahi turned slightly when a calm voice rose beside him, smooth but carrying a strange weight to it.</p>

<p>"These two really are the top mages of our generation," the boy said, watching the cousins with an easy smile. "No doubt about that. But as for who's the top overall… that's still up in the air."</p>

<p>At first glance, he looked like just another upperclassman—tall but not imposing, dressed in a neatly fitted academy coat without a single wrinkle. His hair was dark red, cut short except for a loose strand that fell lazily over sharp amber eyes. His presence wasn't overwhelming, but there was something quietly terrifying about it, like a dormant volcano that hadn't erupted in decades.</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, awkwardly scratching the back of his neck. "Uh… yeah, I guess so. Sorry, but who are—"</p>

<p>He didn't get to finish.</p>

<p>Akari suddenly gasped so hard that it startled him, and Sasaki almost dropped his potion pouch. Both of them stared at the boy with a mix of awe and panic.</p>

<p>"Asahi!" Akari hissed, half whisper, half shriek. "That's— that's Haruto Blaize!"</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded rapidly, his usual shyness completely gone. "Big bro, that's the Haruto Blaize! Number one in the entire academy! The only fourth-year who still joins the tournament!"</p>

<p>Asahi froze mid-blink, his unfinished question dying in his throat. Slowly, he turned back to the boy—Haruto—who was now looking straight at him with that same calm smile.</p>

<p>Haruto tilted his head slightly. "Oh, you haven't heard of me?"</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened as the realization hit him. Wait… this is Haruto Blaize?! The number one student of the entire academy? The only fourth-year who still joins the tournament?</p>

<p>Haruto's amber eyes softened into a faint smile as he spoke. "I came here to warm up. Usually I don't bother with warm-up partners, but… I figured I might as well ask. Could any of you help me? I don't intend to push too hard—I just want a bit of practice."</p>

<p>Asahi's heart skipped a beat. Warm up… with him… here? This is insane.</p>

<p>Without thinking, he stepped forward, his voice steady but tense. "I'll help. And don't go easy on me. In fact… go all out."</p>

<p>Haruto tilted his head, clearly intrigued by the boldness. "All out, you say? Very well… I admire your confidence."</p>

<p>Akari's eyes widened in surprise, her usual cool expression tinged with curiosity. "You really think you can handle that?"</p>

<p>Asahi, ignoring their reactions, clenched his fists, feeling the surge of excitement and adrenaline. This… this is my chance to see what the number one student is truly capable of. I won't waste it. I want to know the very limits… and I'll push myself to match them.</p>

<p>Haruto's smile widened, sparks of energy already flickering faintly around his fingers. "Very well then. Let's begin. Show me what you've got."</p>

<p>Asahi inhaled deeply, augmenting his body to the max, his mind focused entirely on the challenge ahead. This is it… the real test. Time to see the top student in action.</p>

<p>Asahi, Haruto, Akari, and Sasaki made their way toward the duel area, each step drawing more attention than the last. Whispers began to ripple through the hall. Within moments, the rumor spread like wildfire: "Haruto Blaize is here… and he's dueling a first-year?"</p>

<p>Students pushed to the edges, craning their necks to catch a glimpse. The air buzzed with anticipation, every corner of the duel room filling rapidly as people whispered in awe and excitement. Even staff members, normally stern and detached, were peeking from behind pillars and doorways, subtly observing the spectacle.</p>

<p>Asahi's pulse quickened, but he forced himself to stay calm. Looks like everyone wants to see what the number one student can do… and maybe what I'm capable of too.</p>

<p>Sasaki shuffled nervously beside him, muttering under his breath. "I… I can't believe this… I've never seen the duel room this packed…"</p>

<p>Akari's eyes glinted with amusement as she scanned the crowd. "This is exactly the kind of chaos a top duel creates. Let's see how far he can push you."</p>

<p>The duel area itself was already tense, the air crackling with residual magic from previous fights. Every eye was on them now, and the room seemed to shrink under the weight of expectation. Asahi took a deep breath, gripping his fists. Time to find out… the power of the number one student.</p>

<p>Haruto, standing opposite him, simply smirked, sparks of energy dancing faintly around his hands. "Ready when you are."</p>

<p>The duel room was silent for a heartbeat… and then the clash began.</p>
