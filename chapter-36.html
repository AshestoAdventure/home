<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 36 – TEMPORARY MASTER</div>

<p>They entered the adventurer guild's manager room.</p>
<p>The same man from the day Asahi was ranked S was there — the one built like a walking fortress, arms crossed, eyes half-bored.</p>
<p>The headmaster spoke first.</p>
<p>"I'd like you to train this boy for a few weeks."</p>
<p>The guild master looked at Asahi for a moment, then raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Him? You're serious?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>
<p>She leaned forward. "Do you have any idea who his master is? It's Lisa."</p>
<p>The guild master's eyes widened. "Wait... his master is her?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>The man slowly stood up, his expression shifting from disbelief to mild concern. He turned to Asahi.</p>
<p>"Kid," he said carefully, "are you mentally okay?"</p>
<p>Asahi blinked. "...Why?"</p>
<p>The guild master sighed deeply. "Because if you trained under that red-haired witch and came out alive, either you're built different... or you're completely insane."</p>
<p>The headmaster just smiled quietly, clearly amused.</p>
<p>Asahi smiled in an embarrassed way and said, "I somehow managed to pull through her crazy training."</p>
<p>The Guild Master sat back down in his seat and looked at Asahi intently. He seemed to be in deep thought for a moment before speaking.</p>
<p>"Kid, do you really think you have what it takes to reach my expectations?"</p>
<p>"I don't know if I have what it takes or not," Asahi replied firmly, "but I'm definitely ready to take on whatever comes my way."</p>
<p>The Guild Master nodded in approval, then stood up and motioned for them to follow. He led them to the Guild Arena — the same place where Asahi had previously proven his skills against another S-rank adventurer.</p>
<p>"Kid," the Guild Master said, turning to face him, "I want you to come at me with everything you've got. Let's see what you can really do."</p>
<p>The Headmaster was spectating quietly from a corner of the arena while Asahi went into full augmentation mode and rushed toward his opponent — the Guild Master.</p>
<p>The Guild Master didn't even bother drawing his sword. He simply stood there, waiting.</p>
<p>Asahi swung forward, launching a blazing fire slash straight at him. But the Guild Master effortlessly blocked it with his forearm.</p>
<p>Asahi's eyes widened — not even a scratch. Then realization hit him.</p>
<p>"You hardened your skin with magic?"</p>
<p>"Not bad, kid," the Guild Master said with a faint grin. "You figured it out from the very first exchange. I can see now why Lisa decided to train you. You're correct — this is one real application of augmentation."</p>
<p>He stepped forward slowly, his tone turning more serious.</p>
<p>"Right now, all you're doing is the most basic form of augmentation — coating parts of your body with magic to strengthen them. Normally, that would barely get someone to a mid-B rank in strength. But you... you've managed to reach this level because of your absurd efficiency."</p>
<p>He pointed at Asahi with a hint of admiration in his eyes.</p>
<p>"What you're doing is practically unheard of. You're operating at nearly one hundred percent efficiency with every strike — squeezing out every drop of potential from your magic. That's why your attacks hit far harder than anyone else's at your level."</p>
<p>Asahi looked down for a second, clenching his fists.</p>
<p>"So it's my efficiency that carried me all this way... If it wasn't for that, I'd just be another weakling. Thank god I stumbled upon this method while I was in that forest."</p>
<p>The Guild Master chuckled. "Heh. You've come far, kid. But listen well—there are far more advanced ways to use augmentation. Ways that'll make your current form look like child's play."</p>
<p>From her corner of the arena, the Headmaster watched in silence, her arms crossed and eyes narrowing slightly as the Guild Master continued instructing Asahi.</p>
<p>Asahi's movements were raw, but his control… it was frighteningly precise. Every shift in his stance, every flicker of magic around him was refined far beyond what any student his age should be capable of.</p>
<p>If he manages to master the most advanced forms of augmentation, she thought to herself, he might stand on par with the best of my generation… Her gaze softened, a faint, almost proud smile forming on her lips. Or perhaps… even surpass them.</p>
<p>Asahi stopped his attacks, hovering a few steps back as he observed the Guild Master.</p>
<p>Even with a technique like that, he thought, there's no way someone should remain completely unscathed…</p>
<p>Then it clicked. Of course… just like me, he must be strengthening every point of contact to the absolute maximum. Every strike I throw hits against fully augmented parts of his body. That's why nothing is getting through.</p>
<p>A flicker of admiration crossed his mind. So this is what it's like to face someone who truly understands augmentation…</p>
<p>Asahi took a steady breath, eyes narrowing as he fixed his gaze on the Guild Master.</p>
<p>"Are… you doing that?" he asked, his voice calm but filled with curiosity. "Strengthening every point of contact to the max, just like I do?"</p>
<p>The Guild Master's eyes widened slightly, a flicker of surprise crossing his face.</p>
<p>"You… you actually figured that out?" he asked, his tone a mix of curiosity and respect. "Most people wouldn't even notice that level of detail in a fight."</p>
<p>Asahi clenched his fists, a determined look in his eyes.</p>
<p>"So… what can I do about that?" he asked. "Right now, I can't make my attacks any stronger, nor can I make my strikes sharper. How do I break through someone who's reinforcing every point like that?"</p>
<p>The Guild Master nodded slowly, his expression serious.</p>
<p>"Your attack power will naturally grow with time, the more you use your augmentation," he explained. "Right now, you don't need to focus on that. The real problem isn't how strong you hit — it's that only your attack power is high. All this time, you've been getting by easily because your augmented senses let you react before anyone else. But if someone comes along whose senses surpass yours…" He let the words hang in the air. "…then you're left defenseless."</p>
<p>Asahi's mind went quiet for a moment, the realization hitting him hard. That's exactly the predicament I'm facing now because of Haruto Senpai… he thought grimly, his fists tightening at his sides.</p>
<p>Asahi took a deep breath, then bowed deeply, his eyes steady.</p>
<p>"Please… teach me," he said earnestly. "I want to learn how to truly master augmentation and overcome this weakness."</p>
<p>The Guild Master's expression softened slightly, and he gave a small nod.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said. "But I won't be your master. I have no intention of angering Lisa, and I don't want to step on her teachings. I'll give you pointers and guidance, but that's all."</p>
<p>Asahi's eyes lit up, a determined smile forming on his face.</p>
<p>"That's more than enough," he said firmly. "I'll take whatever guidance you can give me."</p>
<p>From her corner of the arena, the Headmaster allowed herself a small, knowing smile.</p>
<p>The next few weeks are going to be fun, she thought to herself, her eyes following Asahi as he prepared to begin his training under the Guild Master's guidance.</p>
