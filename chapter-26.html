<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 26 – A VOLUNTEER</div>

<p>The headmaster's gaze swept over the classroom, sharp and commanding. "Normally, a combatant only has mastery over a single elemental type," she began. "They can only integrate that one element into their sword strikes. It is rare for someone to handle more than one element effectively. Today, for demonstration purposes, I will show you an example using both wind and fire."</p>

<p>She let the words hang in the air for a moment before continuing. "When used harmoniously, wind strengthens fire, increasing its reach and intensity. When used against each other, fire can overpower wind. Understanding these interactions is key to controlling the battlefield."</p>

<p>The classroom murmured in excitement, students leaning forward in anticipation.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, her eyes scanning the room, "I need a volunteer. Someone who can weave both elements into their weapon during combat."</p>

<p>All eyes went wide as the headmaster's gaze landed on Asahi. "Yes… you."</p>

<p>Asahi froze, his jaw dropping. Wait, me? Are you serious? She's pointing at me!</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to protest, but the headmaster's calm voice cut through his panic. "Let's have Ms. Akari demonstrate it for us."</p>

<p>Relief washed over him as he turned to see Akari's arm raised, poised and confident. He let out a quiet, almost inaudible sigh. Thank goodness… I thought she meant me. That would have been… catastrophic.</p>

<p>The class watched in anticipation as Akari prepared her demonstration, her composure perfect, ready to show the subtle integration of two elements that few could even attempt.</p>

<p>Akari stepped gracefully down toward the headmaster, moving with the calm confidence of someone who had done this a thousand times. She turned to face the class, her gaze sweeping across the students before settling briefly on Asahi. She gave him a small, reassuring nod.</p>

<p>Man… she looks so dependable, Asahi thought, a little flustered, I could probably just follow her around forever and not worry about a thing.</p>

<p>He shook his head slightly, trying to focus, but couldn't help the small smile creeping onto his face.</p>

<p>Akari drew her sword, a thin, needle-like blade that seemed almost delicate compared to the heavy weapons most of the students carried. The sword's elegance perfectly matched her calm and precise demeanor. She moved almost like she was dancing, her steps light and fluid, each motion harmonizing wind and fire in perfect synergy.</p>

<p>As she lifted her sword, the air around her shimmered subtly, the wind currents bending to amplify the trailing flames along the edge of her blade. She extended her arm and released a light attack into the air. The strike was not overwhelming, but the effect was mesmerizing—wind carrying the flames forward in a perfect arc, magnifying both speed and heat without losing control.</p>

<p>The students watched in awe, murmuring quietly among themselves as they tried to process the seamless integration of two elements that most could barely handle separately.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes followed every move, his mind racing with both admiration and calculation. Okay… that's definitely something I need to study… she's using the additive properties perfectly, I could adapt that for my own precision strikes.</p>

<p>Even the headmaster's lips curved slightly, approving the flawless demonstration.</p>

<p>As Akari finished her demonstration, the classroom erupted into applause. The students clapped enthusiastically, some even whispering in awe about how perfectly she had handled both elements. The headmaster herself joined in, her expression betraying a hint of admiration.</p>

<p>"As expected of a special student in elemental weaving," she said, her tone approving. "You may return to your seat."</p>

<p>Akari gracefully sheathed her sword and walked back, her movements as fluid as before. When she reached her friends, she gave them a small, playful wink. Their jaws practically dropped, completely captivated by her poise and skill.</p>

<p>Asahi, meanwhile, could only shake his head slightly, impressed despite himself, and made a mental note to study her technique later.</p>

<p>The headmaster turned back to the class, her gaze sweeping over the attentive students. "Now that you have seen an example of how two elements can interact, let us continue our discussion. Understanding the harmonization and opposition of elemental forces is crucial in combat theory. Even if you are limited to one element, knowing how it would react against another in battle can make the difference between a flawless strike and a wasted attack."</p>

<p>She began walking down the aisles, explaining how subtle manipulations of elemental energy could change the trajectory, intensity, and even the area of effect of a strike, and the class listened intently, scribbling notes or simply absorbing the lesson.</p>

<p>Asahi leaned slightly forward, mentally reviewing Akari's demonstration while trying to connect it to the headmaster's explanation. Okay… wind strengthens fire, fire can overpower wind… the interaction could be replicated in combinations of strike patterns… this is going to be useful.</p>

<p>The classroom buzzed quietly with concentration, the lesson continuing with the headmaster breaking down complex concepts in a way that even first years could grasp.</p>

<p>Asahi and Sasaki lingered outside the classroom, still buzzing from Akari's elemental weaving demonstration. Sasaki was staring a little too intently. "That… was amazing. Really precise… so graceful…" he muttered, trying to sound composed but failing just a little.</p>

<p>Akari smirked and crossed her arms. "Right? I'm awesome, aren't I?"</p>

<p>Asahi laughed and stepped forward. "You really are. The way you harmonized wind and fire… that was incredible. Seriously impressive."</p>

<p>Akari tilted her head, giving him a knowing smile. "Thanks, but don't forget. I'm great, yes, but you—well, you're far beyond my league in terms of raw power and speed. And now that your words carry so much weight around here, you should be careful who you admire."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. "Wait, hang on. Why didn't you say that to Sasaki then?"</p>

<p>She raised an eyebrow and grinned. "Oh, that's fine. Both Sasaki and I are top tens, so he can handle some flattery without it being dangerous. You, on the other hand… your words can influence a lot of people. Consider this a public service."</p>

<p>Asahi groaned, rubbing the back of his head. "Of course it's me. Always me."</p>

<p>Sasaki just quietly nodded, clearly taking the comment to heart, while Akari's smirk grew wider.</p>

<p>Asahi scratched the back of his head, a little hesitant. "Hey… Akari, could you… maybe teach me how to do what you just did? The weaving thing with wind and fire?"</p>

<p>Akari raised an eyebrow and smirked. "Oh? So you want to dance around like a girl with a thin little sword, huh?"</p>

<p>Sasaki almost choked on his own breath, wide-eyed. " That is not what big bro means! You can't—he's not trying to—!" He flailed a little, clearly panicking, while Asahi remained perfectly composed on the outside, though inside he was trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>Akari waved a hand dismissively, still grinning. "Relax, I know I'm just joking," she said with a little giggle.</p>

<p>Asahi sighed in relief and smiled. "Alright, alright. Let's… actually practice then."</p>

<p>"Good," she said, clapping her hands together. "Let's go to an empty room, somewhere we won't disturb anyone until lunch."</p>

<p>They walked down the hall and arrived at a vacant battlefield-like training room, the kind with perfectly lined-up mannequins for practice and enough space to swing a sword without breaking anything.</p>

<p>"Perfect," Akari said, twirling her needle-like sword lightly. "Now, let's see if you can even keep up."</p>

<p>Asahi tightened his grip on his sword, a smirk forming. Well, I've survived the 4th layer and fought a top five… I think I can manage this too.</p>

<p>Sasaki hovered just behind them, still a little shaky but excited. "Big bro… you're going to be amazing, I just know it," he muttered, eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>Akari rolled her eyes but smiled. "Okay, let's get started."</p>

<p>Akari raised her sword and began her familiar dance-like movements, the thin blade weaving through the air with grace. Now that Asahi was the one facing her, he could finally appreciate just how difficult it was to predict her strikes. Each motion seemed random, but it was deliberate, perfectly coordinated with wind and fire flowing seamlessly around the tip of her blade. Her attacks weren't just fast—they were actively strengthened by her elemental weaving, and her defense was just as flawless.</p>

<p>So this is why she's a top ten special student… she's truly worthy of it, Asahi thought, his eyes narrowing. He activated his maximum augmented vision, every detail magnified, every movement slowing to near crawl. Even then, he barely managed to block her strikes at the last possible moment, relying on sheer reflex and speed alone.</p>

<p>For a moment, the two circled each other, sparks of wind and fire trailing behind Akari's blade. Then, after a particularly rapid flurry, she stepped back, lowering her sword slightly. "You… you're unbelievably fast," she said, a mix of admiration and surprise in her tone.</p>

<p>Asahi, still catching his breath, noted her next attack. She struck again, confident and aggressive, but this time he left himself fully open. In the blink of an eye, he moved forward, intercepting her sword with his own. Akari barely had time to react. The strike was blocked before she even realized it, her eyes widening in shock.</p>

<p>He lowered his weapon slightly and spoke calmly but firmly. "Your movements are completely unpredictable. Your offense and defense are impeccable. I can only sense the direction of your strikes in the very last second."</p>

<p>Akari blinked at him, a mix of disbelief and respect. For the first time, she realized that Asahi wasn't just fast—he could match her, even with her elemental weaving enhancing every strike.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes narrowed, his stance solidifying. Alright, time to take this seriously, he thought, augmenting his body and vision to the maximum. Every muscle tensed, every fiber attuned to his augmented senses. His movements sharpened, faster than ever, but this time with full focus on keeping pace with Akari.</p>

<p>Akari's lips curved into a smirk as she noticed his change. "Finally… you're taking me seriously," she said, a playful glint in her eye. Her own posture shifted, subtle but deadly, signaling that she would step up her speed and unpredictability even further.</p>

<p>From the sidelines, Sasaki's eyes widened, silently muttering, Even though she's a top ten, her style could confuse a top five easily. The way she mixes unpredictability with high speed… among the top ten, aside from the top five, she's the fastest. She's also the closest to reaching top five level. And big bro… he's actually keeping up with her speed and unpredictability using defense alone, and it's his first time facing her.</p>

<p>Akari's strikes came faster, now weaving combinations of her four elements with seamless precision. Fire and wind flared in tandem to augment the speed and reach of her attacks, earth solidified the ground beneath her for subtle bursts of propulsion, and water formed temporary barriers and fluid motions to redirect force. Each strike came from a different angle, the elements shifting dynamically—sometimes enhancing each other, sometimes opposing—to confuse and overwhelm her opponent. Despite her thin, needle-like sword, the way she danced made it nearly impossible to predict where she would attack next.</p>

<p>Asahi moved fluidly, his maximum augmented vision catching her subtle cues, his body responding almost instinctively. This is insane, he thought. Even with full augmentation, keeping up with her precision, speed, and unpredictability… it's brutal. I could just end this with a precision strike, but then I'd learn nothing.</p>

<p>Akari's strikes flared with elemental energy, testing Asahi at every angle. Fire whipped around the edges of her blade, gusts of wind accelerated each lunge, earth spikes erupted briefly beneath her feet to throw off rhythm, and water arcs guided the flow of attacks and defense. He's actually keeping up, she thought. Matching my style instead of overpowering me… impressive.</p>

<p>Sasaki, still watching, thought about the duel Akari had with Kenzo before. Even Kenzo couldn't fully block her attacks. He had to rely on raw power to break through. And now big bro… he's keeping up with her style, using only speed and defense, and it's the first time he's facing her.</p>

<p>The battle continued, a seamless exchange of attacks and defenses, each strike honed by experience and instinct. Both Akari and Sasaki couldn't help but admire Asahi's adaptability and skill. Meanwhile, Asahi's mind focused on the lesson he was gaining, every strike teaching him how to anticipate and respond to the unpredictable dance of a master weaver, now amplified by her full four-element mastery.</p>
