<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 11 – THE GREAT WITCH</div>

<p>The witch's boots crunched softly over the underbrush as she approached the massive remains of the Obsidian Widow. Its legs were twisted at impossible angles, the carapace scorched and cracked. She knelt briefly, inspecting the carcass, her fingers hovering over the broken limbs.</p>

<p>This was supposed to be a controlled capture, not… whatever this is, she thought, pressing her lips into a thin line. My experiment went completely wrong.</p>

<p>Her gaze shifted to the boy sprawled a few feet away, completely unconscious. His clothes were torn and dirtied, his body smeared with cuts and bruises. The chapped sword and worn spear slung across his back spoke of a long, brutal fight.</p>

<p>He actually defeated it… she thought, narrowing her eyes in surprise. With that little, and so young… Truly remarkable.</p>

<p>She knelt beside him, brushing a lock of hair from his bloodied forehead. So reckless… but strong. If I leave him here, he could die. Part of this is my fault. I cannot let him fend for himself.</p>

<p>Gently, she lifted him into her arms, careful not to jostle his battered body. He'll wake when he wakes, but for now, he needs rest. I must take him to my hut in the fourth layer, where he can recover and I can assess his strength properly.</p>

<p>Adjusting her hold, she began moving northward and upward through the forest. Her robes brushed against ferns and undergrowth, the weight of the boy in her arms a reminder of her responsibility. This forest tests everyone, but he has survived where most would not. I need to make sure he survives what comes next.</p>

<p>The witch's hut in the fourth layer was hidden atop thick roots of ancient trees, smoke curling lazily from a crooked chimney. She set the boy down gently on a mat near the hearth, the firelight flickering across his bruised and bloodied form.</p>

<p>He stirred, eyelids fluttering, and finally opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Red… monster!" he screamed, scrambling to sit up, his hands flailing.</p>

<p>The witch's eyes narrowed sharply, a vein of annoyance forming on her forehead.</p>

<p>"Monster? Monster? I am clearly a human being!" she snapped, her voice echoing off the hut walls. "Do you see horns? Fangs? Do I have eight legs or venom dripping from my fangs? No! I am a human!"</p>

<p>The boy froze, eyes wide, still gripping his chest like a cornered animal.</p>

<p>Wait… she is… human? he thought, squinting. Red hair… normal skin… maybe just… angry…</p>

<p>"I said sit still!" the witch barked, crossing her arms. Her robes swirled dramatically as she towered over him, like a storm cloud ready to strike.</p>

<p>The boy yelped and threw his hands up. "I-I'm sitting! I'm sitting! Don't kill me, red monster lady!"</p>

<p>The witch's cheeks flushed with irritation. "I am not a monster! You are completely ridiculous!"</p>

<p>He paused, tilting his head, still trembling. She talks… she breathes… she moves like a person… She doesn't even smell like a spider…</p>

<p>Slowly, hesitantly, he lowered his hands and whispered, Okay… maybe she's human… or at least looks human…</p>

<p>The witch's arms dropped, though her glare remained sharp. "Finally. Some sense. Do not call me a monster again unless you want to spend the next hour scrubbing that mat with your teeth."</p>

<p>The boy coughed nervously, rubbing the back of his neck. Noted… I definitely do not want that…</p>

<p>He glanced around, finally seeing the hut properly: shelves stacked with jars of strange herbs, crystals glowing faintly in the corners, and a small cauldron bubbling over the fire. So… she's some kind of witch…</p>

<p>"And you," she said, pointing an accusatory finger at him, "you are lucky to be alive. Do you realize what you just did? That spider could have crushed you like a bug!"</p>

<p>He gulped, thinking, Yeah… no kidding. I almost died, and now I have to deal with the red scary lady yelling at me…</p>

<p>The witch exhaled sharply, her tone softening slightly. "I am going to patch you up. You will rest here. And then, maybe, you can tell me why a boy like you is wandering the third layer of the forest fighting monsters alone."</p>

<p>The boy slumped back against the mat, finally letting out a shaky laugh. I fought the spider… and survived… and now I'm being scolded by a human?</p>

<p>"Do not laugh!" the witch snapped, though her lips twitched in what might have been an attempt at a smile.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, thinking, Okay… human… looks human… still terrifying… but at least I'm not a snack…</p>

<p>She carefully set him down on a low cot, her hands glowing faintly with red light. The warmth spread through his aches and bruises, easing the worst of the pain.</p>

<p>"Hold still," she said firmly, but her tone carried something softer beneath the command. "These wounds are severe. You should not be wandering the forest in this state, let alone fighting monsters this size."</p>

<p>He blinked up at her, trying to sit up but wincing. "I… I can't just sit around… I have to keep moving… I have to survive…"</p>

<p>"Survive?" she raised an eyebrow, her sharp gaze studying him. "A boy of your age, alone, surviving in this part of the forest? Explain to me why you are even here. Monsters don't care about your age or courage."</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment, then began recounting everything, his voice low but urgent. "My village… it was attacked… by… a giant newt… huge… like nothing I've ever seen… bigger than any animal I've known… and there were men… men in robes… strange markings on their backs… they controlled the newt… they said something about liberating the village…"</p>

<p>The witch's eyes narrowed, curiosity piqued. "Markings? On their backs? Describe them."</p>

<p>He rubbed his arm as if trying to collect his thoughts. "They were… circular, I think… like… some kind of symbol… I couldn't see all the details. But I remember them glowing faintly when they moved. They were… terrifying."</p>

<p>She leaned back slightly, tapping a finger against her chin. "Symbols that glow… controlling monsters… interesting. That is not common magic. I need to see these marks, or at least learn more. Did you manage to… note anything else about them?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I barely survived… I ran… everyone else… they… didn't make it…" His voice faltered. "I was the only one left…"</p>

<p>She gave a small nod, a mixture of sympathy and fascination in her eyes. "I see… this is no ordinary attack. Those men in robes, controlling beasts, symbols on their backs… there is far more at play here than I first thought. You are fortunate to have survived this long, boy."</p>

<p>He shifted slightly on the cot, still trying to catch his breath and make sense of her calm assessment. "I don't feel… fortunate. Everyone I cared about is gone… the village… my parents… the kids…"</p>

<p>Her gaze softened momentarily, and she muttered, almost to herself, "And yet here you are, still breathing. Perhaps that is what matters for now. I will need to teach you how to defend yourself properly, and how to survive beyond just luck."</p>

<p>He swallowed, trying to steady his shaking hands. "I… I want to… I want to get stronger… I want to… stop being so weak…"</p>

<p>"We will see about that," she said, a spark of determination in her eyes. "But first, you need to recover. Then you will tell me everything about those men, their markings, and the newt. I have questions, and you are the only one who has answers right now."</p>

<p>He nodded weakly, and as she continued her gentle healing magic, his thoughts wandered back to the village, to the chaos, and to the mysterious marks that had glowed on the robed men's backs. A shiver ran down his spine as he realized he had only glimpsed the beginning of something far larger than himself.</p>

<p>He hesitated, staring at the floor as he tried to remember the symbol. "I… I think it looked like a serpent… coiled around a rod… almost like it was protecting it or something…"</p>

<p>Her eyes widened, a flicker of alarm and disbelief flashing across her face. "A serpent… around a rod?" She paused, biting the inside of her lip. "You must not repeat that to anyone. Not a word. For your own safety, it is better you do not know who they are… yet."</p>

<p>He looked up at her, confused. "Wait… why? Who are they? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly, her expression hardening into a mixture of seriousness and resolve. "Not now. It is too dangerous. For now, I will teach you how to survive. How to hold your own in a world that is far more cruel than you realize. That is what matters most at this moment."</p>

<p>He nodded slowly, still trying to absorb the weight of her words. His injuries ached, but a spark of determination began to burn in his chest. "I… I want to learn… I want to get stronger… I want to be ready for anything…"</p>

<p>"Good," she said, a small, approving smile forming. "Then you will train. And you will not just survive, you will endure. But know this…" Her gaze hardened, piercing him as though she could see through his very soul. "There are forces out there far deadlier than even this forest can hide. What you faced so far was only the beginning."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened, a mix of fear and excitement surging through him. "I… I understand. I'll do whatever it takes."</p>

<p>She placed a hand on his shoulder, her touch firm but not unkind. "Then rest. Tomorrow we begin. And remember, not all battles are fought with swords or magic. Some are fought with knowledge, wit, and timing."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, letting exhaustion and relief wash over him. Deep down, he felt that this woman—this mysterious red-haired witch—was not only a savior but perhaps the key to the future that had suddenly opened before him.</p>

<p>Outside, the wind rustled through the forest canopy. The shadows shifted and stretched, and far beyond the clearing where he rested, faint whispers seemed to echo through the trees.</p>

<p>Asahi's lips curled into a determined smile despite the pain and confusion. "I'll get stronger… I'll be ready for anything… no matter what comes…"</p>

<p>And somewhere, just beyond the treeline, unseen eyes watched, waiting for the boy who had survived a newt, a spider, and the cruelty of men in robes, unaware of the trials that were still to come.</p>

<p>The forest seemed to hold its breath.</p>
