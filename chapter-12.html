<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 12 – TRAINING WITH THE WITCH</div>

<p>The morning light slipped through the thick canopy, painting the hut's wooden walls in golden streaks. Asahi stood awkwardly in the corner, tugging at the hem of his new tunic. The witch's magic had stitched together a set of clean, well-fitted clothes for him. The fabric was soft and light, dyed in muted earthy tones that blended well with the forest. For the first time in months, he wasn't wearing rags held together by desperation.</p>

<p>He caught his reflection in a small, polished shard of metal lying on the table. His hair, once a tangled mess of dirt and grease, now looked halfway decent after the witch's cleaning spell. His skin no longer carried the stench of blood and smoke. He lifted his arm and sniffed suspiciously.</p>

<p>I don't smell like a rotting corpse anymore… That's… new.</p>

<p>A strange feeling of comfort spread through him, almost foreign after weeks of filth and battles. For just a moment, he looked less like a ragged survivor of the forest and more like a proper adventurer.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered under his breath, smirking faintly. "At least if I die now, I'll die looking clean."</p>

<p>"Asahi. In here."</p>

<p>The witch's voice carried from beyond a wooden door on the far side of the hut. Asahi straightened his tunic nervously and followed, pushing the door open.</p>

<p>The room he entered was nothing like the simple living space he had woken up in. Shelves lined with strange tomes and jars full of glowing herbs stretched across the walls. A faint incense hung in the air, sharp and sweet, making his head feel both clear and heavy at the same time. At the center stood a sturdy wooden desk, and behind it, a medium-sized board propped against the wall. Strange chalk symbols were already scribbled across it, half-erased as though she had been preparing.</p>

<p>She gestured to a plain chair in front of the desk. "Sit."</p>

<p>Asahi obeyed quickly, the soft creak of the chair sounding too loud in the tense silence. His eyes darted around, catching glimpses of things he couldn't begin to name—scrolls with faded seals, feathers from creatures he didn't recognize, and a single dagger that seemed to hum faintly even at rest.</p>

<p>The witch stepped in front of the board, chalk in hand, her crimson hair catching the light of a nearby lantern. She looked less like someone preparing to lecture a boy, and more like a warlord about to issue commands.</p>

<p>"Today," she said, her voice calm but firm, "you begin to understand magic."</p>

<p>Asahi swallowed hard. Oh boy… I have a feeling I'm going to regret opening that door.</p>

<p>The witch tapped the chalk against the board, and a faint white dust drifted down like snow.</p>

<p>"Magic," she began, "is not some endless stream you pull from the air, nor a battery you charge and drain at will. Magic is life force. It flows through every vein, every breath, every heartbeat. Use too much, and you weaken. Use far too much, and you die."</p>

<p>She drew a crude outline of a human body, tracing lines across it with swift, sure strokes. "The stronger the body, the greater the reservoir. But even the weakest can sharpen their use of it. Efficiency matters more than quantity. Like sharpening a blade, not swinging harder."</p>

<p>Asahi listened, wide-eyed, his fingers tightening on his knees. So I was right. All that exhaustion, the trembling after every fight… it wasn't just fatigue. It was me burning myself away.</p>

<p>The witch's gaze softened ever so slightly as she turned toward him. "And yet," she continued, "for someone with as little magic as you… your refinement is extraordinary. You learned to shape your energy into thrusts and swings that could kill monsters far beyond what your level should allow."</p>

<p>Her eyes glinted like polished rubies. "That kind of instinct is rare. Most mages spend years wasting half their power before learning what you already have."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, his chest tightening with something unfamiliar. She… praised me?</p>

<p>"Uh… so you're saying I'm not totally hopeless?" he asked, trying to mask the flicker of pride in his voice.</p>

<p>The witch gave a sharp, almost amused smile. "Hopeless? No. Reckless? Absolutely."</p>

<p>Asahi sank in his chair, muttering under his breath. Figures.</p>

<p>The witch folded her arms, tapping her finger thoughtfully against her elbow as she studied him. "You know, Asahi… perhaps the very reason you were able to refine your magic so well is because you have so little of it to begin with. A man dying of thirst will savor every drop. You, without even realizing it, had no choice but to perfect every flicker of energy just to survive."</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head, eyes narrowing. So… being pathetic is actually my strength? That doesn't sound very heroic.</p>

<p>The witch turned, sweeping her hand across a nearby shelf. A faint hum echoed as a crystal orb floated into her grasp. She set it on the desk in front of him, its surface shimmering faintly like still water.</p>

<p>"This is a resonance orb," she explained. "It measures the depth of one's magic reserves. The brighter it glows, the greater the pool within. Now, place your hand on it."</p>

<p>Asahi hesitated, rubbing his palm against his new tunic nervously. "And, uh… if it doesn't glow at all?"</p>

<p>The witch smirked. "Then I would tell you to go back to milking cows."</p>

<p>"That's cruel," Asahi muttered, but he pressed his hand to the orb anyway.</p>

<p>For a long, tense moment, nothing happened. The orb sat dull and lifeless. Then, just barely, the faintest glow pulsed within it, like the flicker of a dying candle fighting against the dark.</p>

<p>The witch's red brows rose slightly. "...So little. Almost none at all." She leaned closer, her crimson eyes reflecting the tiny light. "And yet you fought that Arachnid. You fought ogres. Wolves. With this much? Impossible. Truly impossible."</p>

<p>Asahi's heart sank as he stared at the pitiful shimmer. Barely glowing. That's me. The human equivalent of a leaky lantern.</p>

<p>"I knew it…" he sighed, slumping back in the chair. "I'm hopeless."</p>

<p>The witch's hand smacked the table, making him jump. "Fool. Didn't you hear me? You have accomplished with this pitiful amount what others with oceans of magic cannot. That makes you dangerous. Rare. And worth teaching."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, stunned. Dangerous? Me? With this tiny little glow?</p>

<p>Asahi stared at the orb in his hands, its surface faintly shimmering like the last ember of a dying fire. He frowned.</p>

<p>"So this is it? This is all the magic I have? If I've already refined it to the point of perfect efficiency… then what else is there? Am I stuck like this?"</p>

<p>The witch tilted her head, then suddenly let out a soft, almost musical laugh. She shook her head, her long hair swaying.</p>

<p>"You really are an impatient one. Efficiency is only one path, boy. You've refined the water in your cup so that none of it spills—but what if the cup itself grows larger?"</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. "...The cup?"</p>

<p>She stepped closer, tapping the glowing orb with one pale finger.</p>

<p>"Your body is still maturing. Your soul is still young. You have not yet reached the point where your vessel stops growing. And magic… magic responds to growth, to will, to experience. Strength is not just in how cleanly you wield power—it is also in how deep your well can become."</p>

<p>He clenched his fists. "So… you're saying I can still get stronger?"</p>

<p>Her lips curved into a mysterious smile.</p>

<p>"Not just stronger. Different. Efficiency made you clever enough to survive this long with scraps. But there are doors still closed to you, doors you don't even know exist. And when you learn to open them…" She leaned closer, her eyes gleaming with something unreadable. "...even a faint ember can become a blazing sun."</p>

<p>Asahi furrowed his brows, gripping his knees as he leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Wait. I always thought… magic was fixed. Like, you're born with it and that's it. You either have a lot or a little, right? That's what everyone said back in the village."</p>

<p>The witch gave a small scoff, flicking her wrist so that the orb dimmed and floated back onto a nearby shelf.</p>

<p>"That's what people with no imagination say. Magic is not some coin purse you're born with and carry for life. It is life itself. It grows, it shifts, it responds. Even the weakest seed can become a tree, if it finds soil and sunlight."</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head, almost whispering. "So then… mine could grow?"</p>

<p>Her eyes softened for the briefest moment.</p>

<p>"It already has. Haven't you noticed? A boy with barely a drop of magic felled a creature born of my own spellcraft. Fixed from birth?" She laughed, low and amused. "If that were true, you would've been dead long before I ever found you."</p>

<p>Asahi leaned forward, his voice carrying both fear and determination.</p>

<p>"Then… does that mean I can reach their level? The kind of magic the nobles are born with? Can I ever stand that high?"</p>

<p>The witch tapped her finger against the board, her expression unreadable. For a long moment, she said nothing, and the silence pressed on Asahi like a weight. Finally, she exhaled.</p>

<p>"No." Her tone was sharp, leaving no room for fantasy. "You cannot simply grow a noble's well of magic. A pond does not become an ocean just because it wishes to."</p>

<p>Asahi's face tightened, the words cutting deeper than he expected. But before despair could settle, the witch's eyes narrowed with something sly, almost amused.</p>

<p>"However… the size of the pond is not everything. If a fool has an ocean but keeps it shallow and muddy, what good is it? You, boy, with your little pond, have already cleared it until the water runs pure. That is why your fire burns sharper than those with ten times your strength."</p>

<p>Her voice dropped to a near-whisper, deliberate and firm.</p>

<p>"You will never change what you were born with. But you can change how the world feels it."</p>

<p>"How…the world…feels it?"</p>
