<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 15 – ARACHNID REMATCH</div>

<p>Asahi blinked as the witch motioned for him to follow her into a small, dimly lit room.</p>

<p>“Take your shirt off,” she said casually, already rummaging through a shelf.</p>

<p>Wait, what? Asahi’s face immediately flushed bright red.</p>

<p>“I-I’m not used to this!” he stammered, fumbling with his shirt.</p>

<p>The witch paused, glancing at him, one eyebrow raised. Ah… he’s that age, she thought, a hint of amusement in her eyes. Perfectly normal.</p>

<p>“Relax, boy. I’m not judging. It’s just blood magic, nothing more.” She smirked slightly, her tone teasing.</p>

<p>Asahi froze mid-motion, embarrassed beyond belief, muttering to himself. Why do I always end up in these situations…?</p>

<p>Once his shirt was off, she gently took his hand, holding it still as she produced a small vial filled with a faintly glowing liquid.</p>

<p>“This will do,” she said, pricking his finger and collecting a drop of blood. Then she whispered a chant and moved her hands over his injuries. Slowly, the scratches and bruises on his body began to vanish, the wounds closing under her magic.</p>

<p>Asahi let out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding, feeling both relieved and amazed.</p>

<p>Then she knelt behind him, pulling out a small chalk-like wand. Carefully, she began drawing a complex pattern across his back—a magic circle etched with fine, precise lines that shimmered faintly.</p>

<p>“This mechanism will constantly absorb the surrounding magic, the life force around you,” she explained. “It will keep your tiny magic reserve full at all times. You will not need to fear running out in the middle of a fight.”</p>

<p>Asahi’s eyes welled up, overwhelmed with gratitude and emotion. Without thinking, he turned slightly and hugged her tightly.</p>

<p>“Thank you… really… thank you.”</p>

<p>She placed a hand gently on his head, ruffling his hair with a soft smile. “Patience, boy. Now you can face the Widow with one less worry. Let’s see how your pond runs now.”</p>

<p>Asahi backed away slightly, still blushing but now feeling a newfound confidence. I… I really can do this…</p>

<p>The faint glow of the magic circle pulsed on his back, a subtle reminder that he now had something even stronger than skill: constant support from someone who believed in him.</p>

<p>The witch muttered a series of strange incantations, her voice weaving through the trees like wind through leaves. In an instant, the shadows shifted and twisted, and there it was. An Obsidian Widow, towering and massive, its black chitin glinting under the faint light.</p>

<p>No… not again… Asahi’s mind flashed back, memories of the last encounter flooding him—the terror, the running, the pain, and finally, barely surviving. I won’t let it happen like last time.</p>

<p>He took a deep breath, gripping his sword and adjusting the spear on his back. The witch’s calm voice broke through his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Augment your eyes,” she said casually, as if it were the simplest thing in the world.</p>

<p>Augment my eyes? What does that even mean? Asahi hesitated, then shrugged. Well, if she says so…</p>

<p>He focused, channeling magic through his body as before, letting the magic circle on his back draw in the surrounding energy. Immediately, he could feel the power streaming into him, amplifying every muscle, every nerve, every tendon. The exhaustion of the past months seemed to vanish. This… this is incredible… I don’t have to worry about running out anymore.</p>

<p>He shifted his gaze, activating the eye augmentation. Instantly, the world seemed to slow, movements and trajectories clarifying in ways he had never experienced.</p>

<p>The spider lunged, snapping a massive leg toward him, but to his astonishment, it moved far slower than he expected. His vision, enhanced and sharpened, allowed him to see its patterns before it even began. Master… she’s a genius…</p>

<p>He darted forward, every step augmented, feeling the magic converge around him. When he reached striking range, he swung his sword in a wide arc, imbuing it with fire. The attack sliced cleanly through the spider’s limbs, its body, everything in its path. The flames traced the edge in a brilliant crescent of red and gold.</p>

<p>He felt the expenditure of magic, about thirty percent, but within seconds, it surged back through him via the magic circle, leaving him amazed and confident. This… this changes everything. I can fight without fear now.</p>

<p>The Obsidian Widow’s massive body quivered for a moment, then, with a final shudder, it split cleanly in two. Its legs scattered across the ground, lifeless, and the air smelled faintly of burnt chitin. The forest was silent, save for Asahi’s rapid breathing.</p>

<p>The witch stepped closer, her expression calm but her eyes glinting with admiration. “I expected you to struggle a bit more,” she said, clapping her hands once. “But you… you exceeded my expectations.”</p>

<p>Asahi’s chest heaved with exhilaration. He could hardly contain himself. “This… this is incredible! The magic circle… the eye augmentation… they’re amazing!” His hands clenched around his sword, and his face shone with pure joy. I never imagined I could control magic like this. I feel… unstoppable…</p>

<p>The witch’s lips curved into a faint, approving smile. “You’ve grown far beyond what I anticipated, boy. But remember, this is only the beginning.”</p>

<p>Asahi laughed, a mix of relief, triumph, and sheer excitement bubbling out of him. I can’t wait to see what comes next…</p>

<p>The witch folded her arms, her expression somber. “This, unfortunately, will be your last lesson with me.”</p>

<p>Asahi froze, confusion flooding his mind. Last lesson? But I… I’m just starting to understand everything… His chest tightened and his heart sank. “W-what? Why? I still have so much to learn!”</p>

<p>The witch’s eyes darkened slightly, a shadow passing over her features. “There is a certain organization hunting me. The same one that destroyed your village. They are relentless and dangerous. If I stay, they will find me.”</p>

<p>Rage and determination flared in Asahi’s chest. “Then let me fight with you! I won’t let them hurt you!”</p>

<p>She shook her head gently, almost sadly. “You would be crushed before you could even blink. You are strong, but not that strong. That is why you must leave.”</p>

<p>Asahi’s shoulders slumped, the fire in his eyes dimming slightly. Leave… but I just got here…</p>

<p>The witch’s expression softened, a hint of a smile breaking through. “You mentioned wanting to become an adventurer. I recommend you go to the School of Magic, Arctelus, in the capital. Far to the northwest. There you will grow stronger, learn more, and be prepared for what is coming.”</p>

<p>With a graceful motion, she conjured a shimmering portal. She handed him a letter of recommendation, the paper glowing faintly. “Give this to the headmaster. It will secure your place there.”</p>

<p>A sudden tremor shook the ground beneath them. Asahi’s eyes widened. The witch stepped forward and pulled him into a tight hug. “The last two months have been delightful. I will be waiting for you on the front lines.”</p>

<p>Before he could react, her hands pushed him gently but firmly toward the portal. A bright light enveloped him, and the world blurred as he was pulled through, leaving the witch standing calmly on the edge, watching him disappear.</p>

<p>Asahi tumbled through the portal, a mix of excitement, fear, and determination surging through him. I won’t let her down… I’ll become strong enough…</p>

<p>Everything around him was blindingly bright. What… what is happening?</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, he found himself lying on his back on cold cobblestones. He groaned and pushed himself up, dusting off his clothes. The smell of smoke, food, and a hundred other scents filled the air.</p>

<p>He stood and walked cautiously out of the alleyway. Before him stretched a sprawling city, buildings towering above, streets teeming with people moving in every direction. Merchants shouted their wares, carriages rumbled by, and the distant sound of bells echoed through the city.</p>

<p>This… this has to be the capital. His eyes scanned the crowd, determination hardening in his chest. I have to grow strong… I need to help my master as fast as possible.</p>

<p>He tightened his grip on his sword, adjusted the spear on his back, and began moving through the city, weaving between pedestrians and merchants with purpose. Every step felt like a promise to himself. Every glance at the bustling streets reminded him of the danger waiting beyond, and of the vow he had made.</p>

<p>No time to waste. I will become stronger, and I will protect her.</p>

<p>With that thought, he disappeared into the crowd, ready to start the next stage of his journey.</p>
