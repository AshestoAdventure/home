<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 24 – THE TOP SQUAD</div>

<p>The class was finally dismissed, though the air still buzzed with the tension of what had happened. Dozens had left, either shaken by Asahi's display or simply disinterested. In the end, only six students remained, each standing with mixed determination and awe.</p>

<p>Sasaki stepped forward with a clipboard. "We'll proceed with official registration."</p>

<p>The first noble, tall with sharp composure, stepped forward. He bowed politely.</p>

<p>"Takeda Lancaster."</p>

<p>The second noble, elegant and graceful, followed with poise.</p>

<p>"Arisugawa Ravenscroft."</p>

<p>Then came the commoners, each giving their name plainly.</p>

<p>"Ren."</p>

<p>"Kaoru."</p>

<p>"Akari," the redhead said with a cheerful smile, giving Asahi a little wave. He returned it with the faintest grin.</p>

<p>"Kenta," the last murmured, his voice quiet but steady.</p>

<p>Sasaki jotted their names down, officially registering the six who would remain. Asahi watched them with tired eyes, his body still aching from the trial, but a spark of resolve lit inside him.</p>

<p>Far away, in her office, the headmaster leaned back in her chair as she gazed into the crystal orb that displayed the scene. Her lips curled into a wry smile.</p>

<p>By the time the bell rang for lunch, Asahi was still a little stiff from his duel. He made his way toward the dining hall, Sasaki trailing closely behind.</p>

<p>"Big bro Asahi!" Sasaki piped up for what felt like the hundredth time since morning. "The way you handled Kenzo… flawless! You didn't even break a sweat! Well, except at the end, but still, you were incredible!"</p>

<p>Asahi rubbed his temples. "Stop calling me big bro. We're classmates."</p>

<p>"Nope. Can't. Won't." Sasaki grinned from ear to ear. "From now on, you're my big bro. That's final."</p>

<p>"Why do I even bother…" Asahi muttered under his breath, trying to ignore the eyes that followed them as they entered the grand dining hall. Students from every rank whispered among themselves, many shooting quick glances in his direction.</p>

<p>To his dismay, Sasaki only made it worse. He puffed his chest proudly and announced, "Clear the way! Make room for my big bro Asahi, slayer of dons, hero of commoners, and bane of the arrogant!"</p>

<p>Asahi froze, internally groaning. "Oh my god… what did I do to deserve this…"</p>

<p>Around them, students shifted, either amused or stunned, as the duo walked deeper into the hall. Sasaki looked like he was on top of the world, while Asahi just wanted to find a quiet corner to eat in peace.</p>

<p>They managed to find a quiet corner at the edge of the dining hall, away from all the stares. The food here wasn't bad, rich stew, roasted meats, and fresh bread that smelled like heaven. Asahi finally felt like he could relax.</p>

<p>Sasaki, on the other hand, was eating like a man possessed. "Mmm! Big bro, you gotta try this roast! I swear, it's seasoned with magic or something!"</p>

<p>Asahi took a bite, and he had to admit, it was pretty good. After a few moments of silence, curiosity crept up on him. He leaned back a little, eyeing Sasaki.</p>

<p>"Hey, Sasaki… what exactly is your work anyway? I mean, they called you a special student too, but—"</p>

<p>Before Sasaki could answer, a cheerful voice cut in.</p>

<p>"Asahi! Over here!"</p>

<p>They both looked up to see Akari, the redhead from earlier, making her way to their corner.</p>

<p>Sasaki nearly choked on his stew. "I-it's the redhead! Big bro, she's coming here!"</p>

<p>Asahi sighed, muttering under his breath, "Why do I feel like my peace is already over…"</p>

<p>She picked up the small crystal board embedded into the table, tapped a few runes, and ordered something with the ease of someone who had done it a thousand times before.</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled as she leaned forward slightly. "So… congratulations. Not many people can take on Kenzo and walk away standing. That was pretty impressive, Asahi."</p>

<p>Sasaki puffed up his chest, pointing at his "big bro" like he was showing off a prized possession. "Right? I told you, he's amazing! Kenzo didn't stand a chance!"</p>

<p>Asahi gave him a flat look. "…Sasaki, you were literally shivering the entire fight."</p>

<p>"D-don't ruin the moment, big bro!" Sasaki flailed, cheeks pink.</p>

<p>Akari laughed at their antics, her smile softening as she rested her chin in her hand. "Still, he's right. You definitely surprised everyone today. You've already made a name for yourself."</p>

<p>Asahi scratched his cheek awkwardly, not really sure how to take the praise. "Well… I just did what I had to. Nothing more."</p>

<p>Akari's food arrived on a floating tray, sliding neatly onto the table in front of her. She picked up a fork, twirled it in her hand, and said almost offhandedly, "By the way, I don't think I properly introduced myself yesterday. I'm Akari, one of the special students as well."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked mid-bite. "…Wait. You're a special student too?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she smirked, clearly amused by his surprise. "You didn't think you were the only one, did you?"</p>

<p>Before Asahi could reply, Sasaki leaned in eagerly, practically bouncing in his seat. "Big bro, Akari's specialty is elemental weaving! She's incredible at it—her control of multiple elements at once is top tier. She's also assigned to teach advanced elemental manipulation sessions for the academy."</p>

<p>Akari flicked her hair back with mock pride. "Flattery will get you everywhere, Sasaki."</p>

<p>Asahi looked between the two of them, a little taken aback. "So… you two already know each other?"</p>

<p>"Yup!" Sasaki nodded rapidly. "We've worked together a few times. She's saved me from blowing myself up at least three times."</p>

<p>Akari chuckled, taking a bite of her food. "It was more than three, but who's counting?"</p>

<p>Asahi leaned back in his chair, letting that sink in. "Well, guess I really underestimated how many talented people are crammed into this place…"</p>

<p>Asahi leaned forward, eyes narrowing with curiosity. "Elemental weaving… that sounds… complicated. What exactly is it?"</p>

<p>Akari smiled, setting down her fork. "It's not as scary as it sounds. Think of it as controlling multiple elements at once and combining them in intricate patterns. Fire, water, wind, earth—they all respond to a weaving sequence you create in your mind or with hand gestures."</p>

<p>Sasaki practically bounced in his seat. "She can literally make attacks, defenses, or even environmental effects by weaving them together. I've seen her make a storm of fire and wind while manipulating the ground underneath her at the same time!"</p>

<p>Akari nodded, picking up a scrap of paper from the table. With a small gesture, tiny streams of fire, water, and air danced along the lines she drew. "Here, imagine each line is an elemental path. By connecting them correctly, you can make one element enhance another, or control multiple ones at once. It's about precision and timing. That's why it's called weaving."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened slightly. "So… you're basically painting with elements and making them fight for you?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," Akari said, eyes glinting. "It's beautiful when done right. Dangerous if done wrong."</p>

<p>Asahi chuckled softly, a mixture of awe and amusement washing over him. "Hmm… I can see why this school calls you a special student."</p>

<p>Akari smirked, spinning a small flame on her fingertip. "And that's just the crash course. Mastering it… well, that takes years of practice and a lot of magical stamina."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. Eh? Did she just say four?</p>

<p>His mind immediately raced back to his training with his master, remembering how rare it was for someone to manipulate more than two elements at once.</p>

<p>"…Did you just say four elements?" he asked, trying to keep his voice casual.</p>

<p>Akari arched an eyebrow, smirking slightly. "Yep. Fire, water, wind, and earth. All at once."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened. "Wait… isn't that really amazing?"</p>

<p>She leaned back, her smug expression obvious. "Yeah. I'm one of the top ten in the school. That should tell you something."</p>

<p>Asahi nodded slowly..</p>

<p>Sasaki, more matter-of-fact than enthusiastic, added, "She's really skilled. That's why she's assigned to advanced elemental manipulation classes."</p>

<p>Akari gave a small shrug, twirling a strand of her hair. "It's not about bragging. You just don't see many people do this kind of thing."</p>

<p>Asahi let out a soft chuckle, thinking, Freaks… but extremely talented ones.</p>

<p>Asahi turned back to Sasaki, curiosity getting the better of him. "Alright… enough about Akari. What exactly do you do, Sasaki?"</p>

<p>Sasaki adjusted his glasses nervously. "Uh, I specialize in advanced alchemy. That means I create magical constructs, enhance weapons, and refine spells using alchemical techniques. I also handle magical research for the school sometimes."</p>

<p>Akari chimed in, leaning back slightly with an approving look. "He's actually one of the top ten too, just like me. Not many people realize it because he's… well, subtle about it."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened in disbelief. Wait… Sasaki? Top ten? How is that even possible? He doesn't exactly look like the type…</p>

<p>Sasaki rubbed the back of his neck, giving a small shrug. "I just work behind the scenes mostly. Don't expect flashy displays like Akari here."</p>

<p>Asahi shook his head, still processing it. This school… seriously, everyone is some kind of freakishly talented. How am I supposed to keep up?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, across the dining hall, groups of students couldn't help but notice the small cluster at the corner table. Whispers floated through the air as eyes darted toward them.</p>

<p>"Wait… isn't that Asahi?" one student murmured, barely audibly.</p>

<p>"He's the one who defeated one of the top five, right?" another added, eyes wide.</p>

<p>"And sitting with… wait, are those two top tens?" a third voice questioned, incredulous.</p>

<p>The chatter grew quietly, a mix of awe and envy. Some students leaned forward in their seats, straining to get a better look, while others merely shook their heads, muttering to themselves.</p>

<p>Sitting together at that table were Asahi, freshly famous from his duel, Sasaki, reserved but clearly proud to be accompanying him, and Akari, smirking lightly, radiating confidence. The combination of two top tens and the newcomer who had just bested a top five was enough to make even seasoned students pause.</p>

<p>Back at the table, Asahi, Sasaki, and Akari continued their meal, oblivious to the quiet storm of whispers and glances surrounding them.</p>
