<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 10 – THE ARCH ARACHNID</div>

<p>The early morning light filtered through the dense canopy, scattering patches of gold across the forest floor. A red-haired figure moved between the trees, her green eyes sharp and alert as she searched, fingers brushing over the stock of a shortbow strapped to her back. She muttered under her breath, "Where did it go? That arachnid should not have escaped." Her boots sank lightly into the moss, soundless against the soft forest floor.</p>

<p>Suddenly, movement in the branches above caught her eye. A boy, no older than fifteen, faced a massive spider. Its size was monstrous, body slick and black as obsidian, eight eyes glinting in malice. Its legs, thick as tree trunks, scraped across branches and leaves with deafening cracks. The creature hissed, fangs dripping venom that glistened in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"He is fighting it? Alone?" she whispered in disbelief.</p>

<p>The forest canopy shifted with every gust of wind, dappled sunlight creating fleeting shadows across Asahi's tense form. He darted along a network of branches, eyes locked on the massive Obsidian Widow below. Its black, glistening body shimmered like wet stone, and its legs scraped along trunks with deafening cracks. The arachnid hissed, venom dripping from its fangs as its eight eyes glinted in a predatory glow.</p>

<p>"I can't let it corner me… I have to keep moving!" he muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>Branches cracked underfoot as he leapt and rolled, swinging his sword in wide arcs, trying to keep the creature at bay. The edge of the blade glowed faintly with magic, but it was barely enough to scar its thick limbs.</p>

<p>"Come on… come on… why is it so fast?!" His heart pounded in his chest as he narrowly dodged a downward sweep that could have crushed him. Venom splashed past, stinging his arm.</p>

<p>He circled around, slashing desperately, but each swing seemed almost futile against the spider's massive, armored legs. Sparks flew with every impact, leaves and splinters raining around him. The creature's screeches filled the air, wet, bone-chilling sounds that made his stomach turn.</p>

<p>I'm not strong enough… I can't keep up with this… I can't let it end like last time… no, I have to find an opening!</p>

<p>He rolled behind a thick branch as another leg swung past, nearly smashing him. Sweat dripped down his forehead. His breathing was ragged, each movement costing more effort than the last.</p>

<p>There… there's a pattern. The legs… they move in arcs… if I can just hit something vital, something I can exploit…</p>

<p>He lunged forward with a slash, narrowly avoiding the spider's snapping fangs. His sword bit into one leg, sparks flying, but it barely made a dent. He gritted his teeth, jumping back, dodging another blow.</p>

<p>"I can't just keep doing this! I need a plan… I need an edge!"</p>

<p>He crouched low on a branch, eyes scanning the arachnid. The legs were impossibly strong, its body towering over the trees. His mind raced.</p>

<p>Its eyes… if I can blind it… if I can hit the eyes with a concentrated strike… then I can control its movements… yes… yes, that's it… but I need a precise shot… and then… fire swings to finish the legs!</p>

<p>He gripped his spear, tip glowing faintly as he concentrated. He let out a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Fire Thrust!" he yelled, launching a precise magic-infused spear straight at the spider's head. Smoke and sizzling erupted as the magic struck its eye cluster, blinding it temporarily. The creature shrieked in fury, thrashing wildly.</p>

<p>Yes… yes! Now I can get to the legs… I have to move quickly… don't waste a second…</p>

<p>He switched back to his sword, weaving between the spider's snapping legs. Fire crawled along the edge of the blade as he slashed, sparks flying with every strike. He leapt over a massive leg that smashed a branch below, sending splinters into the air.</p>

<p>"Take this! Take this! Fire Swing!"</p>

<p>The crescent-shaped glow from the sword sliced through one thick leg, bark and chitin splintering. The spider screeched, whipping its body toward him, but he rolled behind another trunk, narrowly avoiding its strike.</p>

<p>I can't stop now… I can't… every second counts… I have to keep moving, keep hitting… yes, yes, I can do this!</p>

<p>He danced along branches, slicing and dodging, sweat and blood mixing on his arms as he maintained the rhythm. The spider's legs thrashed, each one a deadly obstacle, yet Asahi's movements were sharper, faster, more precise than ever before.</p>

<p>He took a moment to steady himself, eyes tracking the next leg.</p>

<p>"Fire Swing!" Another leg fell, sparks and flames erupting as the blade met its target.</p>

<p>The arachnid shrieked in fury, its body thrashing, venom spraying. He dodged sideways, rolling across a thick branch, nearly losing balance.</p>

<p>I'm… I'm actually doing it… I can't believe it… but this is insane… it's huge… so strong… every strike feels like it's barely enough…</p>

<p>He slashed again, fire streaking from the blade, and another leg splintered. Each successful strike fueled his adrenaline, yet his body trembled from exhaustion.</p>

<p>Almost… almost there… I have to finish this… I can't let myself fall now… I won't…</p>

<p>He leapt high, spear in hand, glowing tip aimed at the last remaining leg. "Fire Thrust!" The magic-infused spear struck, scorching, and the leg buckled. The spider staggered, blinded, each movement now wild and uncontrolled.</p>

<p>He closed in, using fire swings to finish off the remaining limbs, sparks and smoke filling the air. The creature thrashed one last time before collapsing, body twitching violently, echoing through the trees.</p>

<p>Asahi fell to his knees, sword clattering beside him. His chest heaved, arms shaking, vision blurred. Just before his consciousness faded, a red-haired figure appeared at the edge of the branches. Her eyes were wide, stunned and cautious.</p>

<p>Who… who is that… he thought, barely aware of anything beyond the blur of red hair and green eyes.</p>

<p>The forest fell silent around him, the massive arachnid finally still, while Asahi's body sagged against the branch, utterly spent.</p>

<p>Asahi's vision swam, the world tilting around him. He tried to push himself up but his arms felt like lead. The red-haired figure moved closer, careful and deliberate, but in his haze, her form twisted in his mind.</p>

<p>Another monster? Is this thing… coming for me too?</p>

<p>His chest heaved as he tried to speak, but his words caught in his throat. The forest around him blurred, shadows dancing with the last remnants of fire sparks from the Obsidian Widow.</p>

<p>I… can't… I can't… deal with… another one…</p>

<p>His eyelids grew impossibly heavy. The red-haired figure seemed to loom over him, terrifying and incomprehensible. A single thought raced through his mind before the darkness swallowed him.</p>

<p>This… can't… be real…</p>

<p>And then, nothing.</p>
