<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 28 – THE GRAND TOURNAMENT</div>

<p>Weeks passed in a blur. The routine of the academy settled in: mornings filled with elemental theory, afternoons spent refining control drills, and evenings given to sparring. For most students it was exhausting, but for Asahi it was an endless canvas.</p>

<p>His six students gathered around him during one of their self-study sessions, notebooks open, faces strained with effort. He leaned casually against the desk, hands in his pockets. "Listen carefully. The real goal isn't ninety percent, it isn't ninety-nine. It's one hundred percent efficiency. Every drop of energy used perfectly, no waste. Imagine throwing a punch that lands with all of your strength, not ninety percent, not ninety-five. That's what mastery feels like."</p>

<p>The six stared at him, wide-eyed, as if he had just spoken a foreign language. One of them stammered, "One hundred percent? That's… impossible. Everyone wastes something."</p>

<p>Asahi smirked. "Exactly. Which is why no one even tries. But if you want to surpass the limits, you stop asking if it's possible and start acting like it is."</p>

<p>Silence hung in the room. Confusion mixed with awe. The students scribbled notes furiously, even if they didn't fully understand.</p>

<p>From the corridor outside, a pair of upperclassmen who had lingered out of curiosity exchanged hushed whispers.</p>

<p>"Is he serious? A hundred percent efficiency?"</p>

<p>"He's insane… but you can't deny the way he explains things. He makes the impossible sound like common sense."</p>

<p>"Genius… He doesn't even realize what he looks like to the rest of us."</p>

<p>Asahi, oblivious to the whispers, continued in his calm, matter-of-fact tone. "If you can touch that level, even once, you'll understand. The world looks completely different."</p>

<p>Weeks rolled on like that. Training, lessons, sparring, theory. Slowly, Asahi's name spread through quiet admiration, though he never seemed to care.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as classes ended, he strolled through the empty corridor alone. His footsteps echoed faintly against the walls. His eyes caught on a brightly colored poster pinned to the notice board.</p>

<p>"Academy Grand Tournament," it read in bold letters, with dates, rules, and promises of glory and recognition.</p>

<p>Asahi studied it for a moment, his expression unreadable. Then he scoffed lightly and turned away. I don't need more attention. I don't need trophies. The fights I've already had teach me more than any competition could.</p>

<p>He continued down the hall, his thoughts quiet, until the muffled clamor of the dining hall reached his ears. Pushing open the doors, he spotted Akari and Sasaki at their usual table.</p>

<p>He gave a small wave and walked over, slipping into his seat beside them as if the weight of tournaments, posters, and attention meant nothing at all.</p>

<p>The dining hall buzzed with chatter, trays clattering as students discussed the posters plastered all over the academy walls. Asahi slid into his usual spot beside Sasaki. Without a word, he tapped the glowing board in front of him, selecting a bowl of steaming noodles. It shimmered into existence instantly, the aroma curling into the air as if it had been waiting just for him.</p>

<p>Akari leaned forward, eyes gleaming. "So, when are you signing up?"</p>

<p>Asahi looked up mid-slurp. "For what?"</p>

<p>Sasaki gave him a flat look. "The tournament. Don't play dumb. You saw the posters."</p>

<p>"I saw them," Asahi said, setting the bowl down. "Doesn't mean I care."</p>

<p>Akari smirked. "Please. Everyone cares. The whole school's buzzing about it. And you… you're going to sit out? Yeah, right."</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head. "Why would I waste time? It's just noise. More eyes on me I don't need."</p>

<p>Sasaki shook his head with a short laugh. "You talk like you have a choice. Even if you don't sign up, people will expect you to fight. They'll practically shove you onto the stage. That's what happens when you're the strongest in the room."</p>

<p>Akari poked her food with her chopsticks, grinning. "He's right. You don't have the luxury of hiding anymore, Asahi. Whether you like it or not, everyone already assumes you'll be there. Honestly… I kind of assumed it too."</p>

<p>For the first time that evening, Asahi went quiet. He let the steam rise from his bowl, his reflection rippling in the broth. A faint sigh slipped out. So that's it. Even if I ignore the noise, the noise won't ignore me.</p>

<p>Sasaki leaned back, arms crossed. He doesn't realize it yet, but his decision is already shaping the tournament. Everyone else… they're about to get crushed.</p>

<p>Akari's grin softened into something closer to excitement. I wonder… will he walk through it without trying, or actually get serious? Either way, I want front-row seats.</p>

<p>Asahi finally looked up at them, expression flat. "You two are already talking like I've agreed."</p>

<p>They exchanged a look, then said in unison, "You have."</p>

<p>Asahi tapped the glowing board beside him, ordering curry rice. The dish shimmered into existence on his tray a second later. He dug in slowly, half listening as his friends kept glancing at him.</p>

<p>Finally, he sighed. "Alright, what's so special about this tournament that you're all staring at me like I've already signed up?"</p>

<p>Akari arched a brow, her chopsticks pausing mid-air. "Special? This is the tournament, Asahi. The one that decides the Top 20 rankings."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded, his tone matter-of-fact, as if Asahi had just asked what color the sky was. "Anyone who breaks into the Top 20 gets privileges the rest of the school can only dream of."</p>

<p>Asahi chewed on a mouthful of rice, unimpressed. "Like what?"</p>

<p>Akari leaned forward with a sly grin. "Like claiming any classroom whenever you want. No permissions, no paperwork. Just walk in and it's yours."</p>

<p>Sasaki added, adjusting his glasses. "Unlimited access to resources. Alchemy labs, training grounds, restricted archives—you name it."</p>

<p>Asahi raised an eyebrow, but they weren't finished.</p>

<p>Akari smirked, resting her chin on her hand. "And if you're really good, you can even hold your own classes. Teach, experiment, earn. It's practically running your own guild inside the academy."</p>

<p>Sasaki's eyes glinted. "Speaking of guilds—Top 20 students are automatically registered with the Adventurers Guild. B-rank minimum. Some jump higher depending on what they show here."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, his spoon hovering midair. "…So basically, free pass to money, power, and fame?"</p>

<p>Akari grinned wider. "Exactly. It's obvious, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Sasaki gave a small shrug. "Honestly, Asahi, the whole school already assumes you'll be there. It's not a matter of if. It's a matter of where you'll land."</p>

<p>Asahi set his spoon down, staring at them both flatly. "…You two talk like I'm already Top 10 material."</p>

<p>Asahi froze with his spoon in midair, blinking at the two across from him. "Wait. If this tournament decides the rankings, then how are you guys already Top Ten? We're in the same year."</p>

<p>Akari smirked like she'd been waiting for that. She leaned back, chopsticks twirling lazily between her fingers. "There are two tournaments every year. Winter and summer. We made our move in the last one."</p>

<p>Sasaki, ever the calm one, adjusted his glasses with a small push. "I placed tenth."</p>

<p>"And I," Akari cut in before he could finish, grinning wide, "took sixth. Not bad for a first year, huh?"</p>

<p>Asahi tapped his spoon against the plate, eyes on Akari. "Given how you fight, I can see how you ended up sixth. Makes sense now."</p>

<p>Akari's grin widened, clearly taking that as praise. "Oh? Finally admitting I'm amazing?"</p>

<p>"Don't push it," Asahi muttered, though a faint smile tugged at his lips.</p>

<p>Then he glanced at Sasaki. "But you… you never actually showed us how you fight, did you?"</p>

<p>Sasaki's eyes flickered with seriousness. "Big bro Asahi… if I don't prepare, I'm pretty useless. My specialty is alchemy, not direct combat. Without planning, I'd just get in the way."</p>

<p>Akari leaned back slightly, her smirk widening as she watched Sasaki. "Yeah, but that's the thing—once he's prepared, he's a completely different problem. People think he's just some quiet first-year, but the moment he's set up his alchemy, the battlefield changes. Every trap, every potion, every timing… it all comes together perfectly. You underestimate him at your own risk."</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head, curiosity flickering in his eyes. "So… how long does it take you to get ready for a fight like that?"</p>

<p>Sasaki straightened, a confident gleam in his eyes. "Honestly? My potions, my traps… all of it's set up already. I could step into a battle tomorrow and be ready."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes lit up instantly, a spark of excitement in his gaze. "Then show us tomorrow!"</p>

<p>Akari's grin matched his enthusiasm. "Yeah, let's see what you've got, Sasaki!"</p>

<p>Sasaki blinked, a small smile tugging at his lips. "I… can't. If I waste my potions tomorrow, I'd have to make more before the tournament. Patience. Wait until then."</p>

<p>Both Asahi and Akari groaned in unison, clearly disappointed, but they exchanged a glance and nodded. "Fine," Asahi muttered. "We'll wait."</p>

<p>Akari clapped her hands together, shaking off the frustration. "Alright then, enough whining. Shall we go register for the tournament now?"</p>

<p>Asahi opened his mouth as they started walking toward the dining hall exit. "Hold on—I haven't decided if I even want to join the tournament yet."</p>

<p>Both Akari and Sasaki raised an eyebrow, perfectly in sync.</p>

<p>Before he could protest further, they were suddenly tugging on his arms, dragging him down the hallway like a stubborn child. Asahi stumbled, feet sliding along the polished floor, and shouted, "Hey! Wait! I'm walking here!"</p>

<p>Sasaki's grip was surprisingly firm for a first-year. "Big bro Asahi, you absolutely have to join! You'll definitely make Top Five—there's no doubt about it!"</p>

<p>Akari fell in stride beside them, smirking. "Exactly. The three of us together? We're going to shake this tournament up. Everyone else won't know what hit them."</p>

<p>Asahi groaned, trying to loosen their hold. "I don't want more attention! I'm fine keeping my head down!"</p>

<p>Sasaki let out a laugh, shaking his head. "Big bro, you already have plenty of attention. You can't escape it."</p>

<p>Akari nudged him lightly. "So you might as well make it worth your while."</p>

<p>Asahi muttered under his breath, but there was no stopping them. The three of them barreled down the hallway, leaving a trail of curious glances and faint laughter from the other students.</p>
