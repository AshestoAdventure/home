<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 16 – THE SCHOOL OF MAGIC</div>

<p>Asahi walked slowly through the busy streets, his eyes wide with curiosity. Shops and stalls lined both sides of the stone-paved road, bursting with color and life.</p>

<p>On his left, a blacksmith hammered away at glowing steel, sparks flying with every strike. Next to him, a potion vendor displayed bottles filled with swirling liquids that shimmered in the sunlight. Across the street, the warm, sweet smell of fresh bread drifted out from a bakery, making his stomach growl.</p>

<p>I definitely cannot afford half of this… maybe not even a quarter, he thought, feeling both amused and embarrassed as he clutched his light coin pouch.</p>

<p>Children ran past, laughing. Adventurers in polished armor bargained for supplies. A group of robed magicians carried stacks of books, and a merchant leaned forward with a grin.</p>

<p>“Hey boy, finest cloaks from the East. Only three silver.”</p>

<p>Asahi waved nervously and kept walking, his gaze darting from shop to shop. Everything felt overwhelming, yet exciting.</p>

<p>So this is the capital.</p>

<p>He pulled the letter of recommendation from his pocket, staring at the wax seal that shimmered faintly with magic. His grip tightened.</p>

<p>Arctelus… the School of Magic. That is my first step.</p>

<p>With renewed determination, he tucked the letter back into his coat and continued down the bustling street.</p>

<p>Asahi stopped at a fruit vendor’s stall, the sweet scent of ripe apples filling his nose. He hesitated for a moment before leaning in.</p>

<p>“Excuse me… could you tell me where the School of Magic, Arctelus, is?”</p>

<p>The vendor, a round man with a stained apron, raised an eyebrow and gave him a look of disbelief.</p>

<p>“What? You don’t even know that? Kid, do you live under a rock?”</p>

<p>Asahi scratched his cheek awkwardly, laughing nervously.</p>

<p>“Uh… kind of. I’ve been… traveling.”</p>

<p>The vendor sighed and jabbed a thick finger toward the towering structure that dominated the skyline. At the heart of the city stood a grand castle-like building with spires that seemed to pierce the heavens.</p>

<p>“There. The big one in the center. Hard to miss.”</p>

<p>Asahi blinked in surprise.</p>

<p>“Wait… that looks like the royal palace, not a school.”</p>

<p>The vendor smirked.</p>

<p>“And you’d be half right. The palace and the school are connected. Nobles, royals, prodigies… they all study there. That’s why it looks like a palace. Because it sort of is.”</p>

<p>Asahi turned his eyes back to the massive structure, his chest tightening with both nerves and excitement.</p>

<p>So that’s Arctelus… it doesn’t just look intimidating. It feels intimidating.</p>

<p>Asahi bowed slightly, a grateful smile tugging at his lips.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I appreciate the help.”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and began walking toward the towering palace-like school, weaving through the crowd with his ordinary sword bouncing lightly at his hip. His steps carried a hint of eagerness, like someone about to step into an unknown but long-awaited world.</p>

<p>The vendor watched him go, rubbing his chin.</p>

<p>That boy… what’s he thinking, asking about Arctelus? Only nobles or prodigies get through those gates. He doesn’t look like either.</p>

<p>His eyes fell on the worn, ordinary sword strapped to Asahi’s side.</p>

<p>Even his weapon screams commoner. That school would chew him up and spit him out before he could take a single step inside.</p>

<p>The vendor shook his head, muttering under his breath as Asahi disappeared into the crowd.</p>

<p>“Kids these days… chasing dreams they can’t possibly reach.”</p>

<p>But the faintest glimmer of curiosity lingered in his gaze as he turned back to his apples.</p>

<p>Asahi’s pace quickened as the streets grew wider and cleaner, the buildings taller and grander. The chatter of common folk faded, replaced by the clipped tones of finely dressed nobles. Carriages decorated with gold trim rolled past him, their passengers peering down with the same kind of glance one gives a stray dog on the roadside.</p>

<p>So this is what the noble district feels like… A whole different world.</p>

<p>He adjusted the strap of his sword, feeling their stares cling to him like dust, but pressed forward until the looming silhouette of Arctelus filled his vision. The school looked less like an academy and more like a fortress carved from ivory stone, with towers spiraling into the sky and banners fluttering proudly in the wind.</p>

<p>At its gates stood two armored knights, their silver plate glinting in the sun, swords at their hips and halberds resting against their shoulders. Their presence alone radiated discipline and authority, the kind of aura that could stop anyone unworthy from taking another step forward.</p>

<p>Asahi exhaled slowly, his hands tightening at his sides.</p>

<p>Alright… this is it. The place Master entrusted me to. The place I’ll grow stronger.</p>

<p>He stepped closer, the shadow of the gates stretching over him, and the sharp eyes of the knights immediately fell upon the lone boy with an ordinary sword.</p>

<p>One of the knights shifted his halberd to block Asahi’s path, the steel tip gleaming dangerously close to his chest.</p>

<p>“Halt. State your business.”</p>

<p>Asahi straightened his back, trying not to look intimidated.</p>

<p>“I want to enroll in the school.”</p>

<p>The knights exchanged glances before both burst into laughter, the sound echoing across the massive stone walls.</p>

<p>“You? Enroll here?” one said, his voice dripping with amusement. “Do you even know where you are, boy? This is Arctelus, not some countryside dojo.”</p>

<p>The other knight chuckled harder, wiping a tear from his eye. “Run along before you embarrass yourself. Only nobles and the chosen few get past these gates. You don’t look like either.”</p>

<p>Asahi clenched his fists but kept his ground.</p>

<p>“I have a letter. For the headmaster.”</p>

<p>That made them laugh even harder, the first knight doubling over with a booming roar.</p>

<p>“A letter for the headmaster? From you? What’s next, are you the prince in disguise?”</p>

<p>The second smirked cruelly, looking him up and down. “That sword of yours couldn’t even scare off a rat, yet you’ve got business with the headmaster? Kid, you’re two steps from being thrown in the street.”</p>

<p>Stay calm. Master told me to come here for a reason.</p>

<p>Asahi tightened his grip on the folded letter in his pouch, his heart pounding but his resolve unshaken.</p>

<p>A sharp, commanding voice rang out from behind the knights, slicing through their laughter like a blade.</p>

<p>“Is this how you treat those who come seeking knowledge? Have you forgotten this school’s founding creed—that every soul, noble or common, deserves the chance to prove themselves?”</p>

<p>The knights stiffened instantly, their faces draining of color. They spun around and immediately dropped to one knee.</p>

<p>“Headmaster… forgive us!”</p>

<p>Asahi blinked in surprise. Standing there was an elderly woman, her back straight despite her age, her presence radiating authority. Her silver hair was tied neatly, her robes embroidered with faintly glowing runes that shimmered like starlight. Though her body was frail, her eyes carried a sharpness that could cut stone.</p>

<p>She regarded the knights coldly before turning her gaze to Asahi.</p>

<p>“You. Come with me.”</p>

<p>Her tone left no room for argument.</p>

<p>Asahi nodded quickly, hurrying after her as the knights bowed their heads lower, shame etched across their faces. Still, as he passed them, he caught the flicker of their displeasure, their narrowed eyes seemed to say that they fully expected him to return soon, broken and humiliated.</p>

<p>They’re waiting for me to fail, Asahi thought, his grip tightening around his pouch. Then I’ll just have to make sure I don’t.</p>

<p>The headmaster’s eyes narrowed slightly, her gaze steady on Asahi.</p>

<p>“Tell me everything. From the very beginning.”</p>

<p>She found me when I was lost, wandering without purpose. She taught me everything, not in classrooms, but in forests, mountains, and storms. Every lesson pushed me beyond my limits until I understood without words.</p>

<p>He spoke of the night of the attack, his voice tightening.</p>

<p>“They came in the dead of night. Robed men… cloaked in shadows. Their voices were strange, like echoes from a cavern. They weren’t after me. They were after her.”</p>

<p>The headmaster leaned forward slightly, her sharp eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“She fought them. She told me to run, but I couldn’t. I tried to stay. But the magic they used… it wasn’t normal. The air cracked with it. She held them off, but before I knew it, I was flung away by her spell. When I woke, she was gone.”</p>

<p>The room fell silent. Even the torches seemed to hush their crackling.</p>

<p>The headmaster studied him carefully, fingers interlaced beneath her chin.</p>

<p>“Robed men,” she repeated. “And she… never told you her name?”</p>

<p>Asahi shook his head.</p>

<p>“Never. She only taught me, trained me. She was my master. Nothing more.”</p>

<p>The headmaster closed her eyes briefly, exhaling a long breath.</p>

<p>“Yes. That does sound like her.”</p>

<p>Then her gaze snapped back to him, sharp as a blade.</p>

<p>“You’ve stumbled into a storm far larger than you realize, boy. Those men… they are not to be spoken of lightly.”</p>

<p>The headmaster’s face softened, the stern lines easing as she regarded him with equal parts sympathy and appraisal.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for what happened to your village. There are losses no apology can fix.”</p>

<p>Her voice actually means it. She understands more than I thought.</p>

<p>She inclined her head, the weight of her office settling into her posture. “Anyone who endured what you did and who was taken in by Lisa is not ordinary. Lisa does not waste her time on the weak or the foolish. If she saw something in you, that is worth our attention.”</p>

<p>Asahi felt a heat rise in his chest, a strange mix of pride and a hollow ache. She trusted me. I can’t just be grateful — I have to prove I deserve it.</p>

<p>The headmaster’s gaze sharpened, authority humming just beneath her calm tone. “Because of who you are and who raised you, you will not undergo our usual entrance trials. The academy’s tests are designed for typical applicants. You are not typical.”</p>

<p>Asahi’s mouth went dry. “You mean… I don’t have to take the normal test?”</p>

<p>“Correct.” Her nod was slow, decisive. “Your trial will be immediate and personal. You will fight me here, under these halls. Prove that you can stand, prove that your control and resolve are real. If you do not, then no letter or favor will change your fate.”</p>

<p>Fight her now? The thought crashed through him, equal parts terror and the spark of a challenge.</p>

<p>Before he could steady himself, the headmaster’s hand rose and the air in the chamber thickened. Runes on her sleeves flared, and the duel platform beyond the doors humbly opened as if it had been waiting. “We begin at once,” she said</p>

<p>Asahi’s heart pounded. He steadied his breathing, fingers finding the hilt of the sword the witch had given him. No hesitation. Master taught me that. Lisa trusted me with fire and life. I cannot waste this.</p>

<p>The headmaster stepped back, robes folding like midnight waves. Her voice was soft but absolute. “Show me what two months of survival and training with Lisa have made of you.”</p>

<p>Asahi tightened his grip, muscles humming with augmented energy. “I’ll fight.”</p>
