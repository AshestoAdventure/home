<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 37 – REDHEADED CHALLENGE</div>

<p>The following weeks became a whirlwind of intense, chaotic, and occasionally hilarious training for the trio.</p>

<p>Asahi spent most of his days at the Guild Arena, working under the watchful eye of the Guild Master. Every morning, he would arrive before sunrise, stretching his body and tuning his magic to perfection. The Guild Master rarely spoke much, letting Asahi push himself while occasionally offering cold, precise corrections.</p>

<p>"Faster!" the Guild Master barked one morning as Asahi attempted a double fire swing. Asahi misjudged the angle, and sparks flew dangerously close to him.</p>

<p>"Again!" the Guild Master shouted, his massive fist suddenly colliding with Asahi's shoulder as a demonstration of the impact's force. Asahi yelped, staggering back but grinning through the pain. Okay, that hurt… but it'll stick this time, he thought.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Akari had retreated to a quiet grove outside the academy grounds. She was weaving elemental magic with an intensity that made the wind itself shiver. Gusts of air danced around her fingers, flames flickered in midair, water spiraled like sentient serpents, and the earth under her feet quaked slightly.</p>

<p>But Akari was not immune to mishaps. One miscalculation, and she overextended a wind loop, sending herself tumbling backward into a pile of soft moss. "Oof!" she grunted, getting up and brushing herself off. "Maybe I need a bit more control…" she muttered, trying again, her eyes glowing with determination.</p>

<p>Back in the alchemy lab, Sasaki was a picture of chaos and concentration. Glass vials, powders, and mysterious liquids were strewn across every surface. His hands moved with surprising speed as he concocted potions that could instantly enhance physical strength or sharpen mental acuity.</p>

<p>"Just a pinch more of this…" he murmured, peering into a bubbling flask. In a sudden, loud POP, the potion exploded, coating him head to toe in black soot. He coughed, sputtered, and looked down at himself, completely pitch black. "Not again…" he groaned, muttering to himself as he scrambled to clean up.</p>

<p>Through it all, the trio pushed themselves to the limits. Akari's magic became more fluid, blending elements in ways that made the air around her shimmer with raw power. Sasaki's potions became more potent — and safer — though the occasional explosion remained a comic hazard. And Asahi, under the Guild Master's harsh but insightful guidance, was slowly learning the art of advanced augmentation, realizing how much more he could push his body and magic in combination.</p>

<p>There were small victories each day: Asahi landing a precise, perfectly augmented strike that barely made the Guild Master flinch, Akari completing a flawless elemental weave that sent leaves dancing perfectly in time with her motions, and Sasaki finally concocting a potion without setting off an explosion that covered the lab in soot.</p>

<p>Yet, for every success, there was a comedic failure waiting. Asahi's arm once sparked uncontrollably when he pushed too far in an experiment, leaving him hopping in place to avoid burning the arena floor. Akari's wind loops occasionally caught nearby birds, sending them squawking into the sky as she muttered apologies. Sasaki's "harmless" smoke bomb potion once blacked out half of the lab's windows, leaving him looking like a tiny, smoldering shadow figure as he waved apologetically at the cleaning staff.</p>

<p>By the end of each day, all three would collapse, exhausted but exhilarated. Sweat streaked faces, scorched robes, singed hair, and soot-streaked skin were common, yet their eyes burned with the thrill of progress.</p>

<p>The Headmaster appeared at the Guild Master's office once again, her presence commanding as always. The Guild Master looked up from the papers scattered across his desk and raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you," he said, a hint of amusement in his voice.</p>

<p>"How's the progress been?" she asked, her tone calm but carrying a weight of expectation.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, his muscular frame filling the space, and exhaled slowly. "Honestly… that kid is terrifying. In just a few weeks, he's learned things that would take even someone with extreme talent at least half a year to grasp. I can see why Lisa would take him in."</p>

<p>The Headmaster allowed herself a small, approving smile. "He might be the one to deal with that predicament," she said softly, almost to herself.</p>

<p>The Guild Master's gaze hardened, his eyes narrowing. "You mean… they made their move?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied steadily. "Lisa has been holding them back all this time, but even she can't handle that entire organization alone."</p>

<p>The Guild Master's expression turned grave, the weight of thought pressing down on him. "Just when is this tournament starting? Couldn't they have picked a better time?"</p>

<p>The Headmaster's gaze remained calm but sharp. "I think their goal is precisely that tournament. They probably want to cripple all the future pillars of our side, especially the prince, Ryunosuke."</p>

<p>The Guild Master paused, running a hand over his jaw. "Surely they won't attack with the two of us here."</p>

<p>"They might," she replied, her tone clipped, "if they move their top order."</p>

<p>The Guild Master's eyes widened, a chill running down his spine. He stood abruptly, the sound of his chair scraping the floor echoing. "The… the Seven Evil Deities… huh. Even we can only take one… at most two at a time."</p>

<p>Asahi, Sasaki, and Akari reunited in the dining hall, the familiar clatter of plates and hum of conversation surrounding them. Asahi slid into a seat between the other two, rubbing the back of his neck with a tired smile.</p>

<p>"How was the training?" he asked, genuinely curious.</p>

<p>Sasaki leaned forward, his eyes wide with a mixture of exhaustion and excitement. "It… it was intense. I've never pushed myself like that before, but I feel like I've learned so much."</p>

<p>Akari smirked, giving a small shrug. "It was challenging, but I think I improved a lot. A few things even surprised me about my own weaving."</p>

<p>Asahi nodded, feeling a spark of satisfaction. "I thought I was ready, but the Guild Master pushed me in ways I never expected. It's like I learned more in these few weeks than I did in months before."</p>

<p>Sasaki glanced between them, grinning shyly. "It sounds like we all got stronger… thanks to each other, I think."</p>

<p>Akari leaned back, crossing her arms, a faint smile tugging at her lips. "Don't get cocky yet. The tournament isn't going to wait for anyone. But… yeah, we've all grown."</p>

<p>Asahi let out a deep breath, feeling a sense of camaraderie and determination settle over them. "Then let's make sure we're ready for whatever comes next."</p>

<p>The three exchanged determined glances, the hum of the dining hall fading into the background as they silently reaffirmed their shared goal.</p>

<p>The dining hall doors swung open and Renji Boleyn entered with his gang, the room instantly quieting as they made their presence known. Their eyes scanned the hall, and finally, Renji's gaze landed on Asahi and his companions.</p>

<p>Calmly, almost with an evil smirk, Renji walked toward them, his steps deliberate and measured. He stopped in front of Asahi and said, "So… you got knocked down a peg by Haruto, didn't you? Serves you right for getting too big-headed."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked and stared at him blankly, thinking, Jeez… why's this guy always trying to pick a fight with me?</p>

<p>Akari's eyes flared and she stood up, shouting, "Renji! Go away and mind your own business!"</p>

<p>Sasaki shrank slightly behind Asahi, fidgeting nervously while Asahi simply leaned back, trying to decide whether to engage or ignore him.</p>

<p>Renji's gaze swept over Akari with a menacing intensity, and she flinched instinctively. Then his eyes returned to Asahi.</p>

<p>"You better be ready for next week," he said with a smirk. "Try not to disappoint anyone."</p>

<p>With that, he turned and walked away, his gang trailing behind him like shadows.</p>

<p>Akari let out a quiet sigh and lowered her gaze. "I'm sorry about my half-brother," she said softly. "That's just how he is. He's never been good to anyone… especially not me."</p>

<p>Asahi nodded slightly, still processing the encounter, while Sasaki fidgeted nervously, muttering, Wow… that guy's intense.</p>

<p>Asahi watched Renji swagger away with his gang, the smirk on the boy's face like a challenge thrown like a coin. He glanced back at Akari once, seeing the shadow flicker across her expression and deciding not to pry. Some doors you don't open unless someone hands you the key.</p>

<p>Then his gaze slid back to Renji, calm, almost amused. If I get to fight him, I'll make sure to fix that attitude, he thought, a small, confident smile tugging at his lips. Not malicious. More like polishing a rusty sword until it behaves.</p>
