<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 5 – GEARED UP</div>

<p>Asahi lunged from the branch, spear aimed at the closest kobold.</p>

<p>Here goes… got to make this count…</p>

<p>He hit his target, but not the one he had hoped for. His spear struck the kobold with the rusty dagger instead of the one with the proper sword. The smaller kobold yelped in surprise and scrambled backward, clutching its weapon.</p>

<p>Ugh… seriously? That's the one? I was aiming for the sword!</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth, disappointment flashing across his face as he readied himself for the next move.</p>

<p>"Of all the luck… always the wrong one first!"</p>

<p>The other two kobolds turned at the commotion, eyes narrowing. The one with the barely rusted sword and the rusty blade both stepped forward, weapons raised, alert to the danger.</p>

<p>Okay… doesn't matter. One at a time. Focus. Fire Thrust and spear. Just keep moving and don't get hit.</p>

<p>He tightened his grip on the spear, shoulders tense, and prepared for the chaos that was about to unfold.</p>

<p>The kobold with the rusty sword had already fallen to Asahi's ambush. Two remained: the dagger kobold, yipping nervously, and the one with the barely rusted sword, eyes locked on him, glinting with menace.</p>

<p>Alright… focus. One at a time.</p>

<p>The dagger kobold lunged, squeaking, "Squeak! Squeak!", its tiny blade swinging unpredictably. Asahi parried clumsily with his spear, the wood scraping sharply against metal. Clang! Leaves shivered around them as the sound echoed.</p>

<p>He feinted left, then thrust straight. The kobold yelped in surprise and misstepped. Asahi took the chance, swinging the spear in a clean arc straight into its chest. Thump! The kobold squealed, "Aaaah!", and collapsed, trembling.</p>

<p>Wait… that actually worked? Without any magic?</p>

<p>His heart raced. If I could take out this one without Fire Thrust, then the one with the proper sword… that should be easy. Confidence crept in, though wariness remained.</p>

<p>The sword kobold stepped forward, carefully testing his range. Asahi held the spear tight, muscles coiled. He focused, channeling magic into the tip. The faint red glow shimmered along the stone.</p>

<p>He pulled the spear back, took a deep breath, and then thrust forward.</p>

<p>"FIRE THRUST!"</p>

<p>This time, the spear seemed to have a mind of its own. The magic-infused tip glided smoothly through the air, unerringly straight to the kobold's forehead. Flames burst out in a sizzling, frying wave as it struck. "Screeeek!" The kobold shrieked, convulsing as fire licked its fur and leather before it collapsed in a smoldering heap.</p>

<p>Asahi's hands tingled from the magic as he panted, gripping the spear tightly. Smoke curled lazily upward from the scorched kobold, and the forest was silent except for rustling leaves and distant birds.</p>

<p>Okay… that's one more step forward. I'm stronger than I thought… but I need to keep moving. This forest isn't forgiving.</p>

<p>Asahi crouched over the fallen kobolds, surveying their meager stash of weapons. He picked up the rusty dagger and the rusty sword, examining them carefully. Then his eyes fell on the clean, barely rusted sword. Its edge was sharp, its hilt intact. He ran a finger along the blade and lifted it slightly, feeling the balance.</p>

<p>The hilt is still perfect… that means I can carry this properly. At least I won't be swinging it like a stick everywhere.</p>

<p>He slung the weapons over his back, keeping the fine sword as his main weapon. With his makeshift spear tucked aside, he moved cautiously through the branches, hopping from tree to tree, scanning the forest floor below. Every snapped twig and rustling leaf made him tense.</p>

<p>Then he saw it.</p>

<p>A body. Well, what was left of it. The forest had not been kind. Flesh torn, bones scattered, blood dried into the soil and leaves. Monsters had clearly ripped everything apart, leaving little more than a horror-stricken outline of a person.</p>

<p>Asahi froze, stomach knotting. This… this is what happens in this forest… if you are unprepared.</p>

<p>He dropped to the ground softly and knelt beside the corpse. I… I'm sorry. I can't do anything for you, but I promise your death won't be meaningless.</p>

<p>He rummaged carefully through the remains, his fingers trembling as he pulled out leather armor, a pair of boots, a small pouch, and the sword's hilt, all of which had somehow survived mostly intact. They were battered and stained, but usable.</p>

<p>Thank you… for the sword, the armor… I'll make sure it helps me survive.</p>

<p>He strapped the armor and boots onto himself and secured the pouch. Holding the clean sword in his hands, he noted once more how the intact hilt made it easy to carry and wield. A small but vital comfort in a forest where death lurked in every shadow.</p>

<p>He bowed his head briefly, murmuring a quiet prayer for the lost adventurer, then turned and moved carefully back through the forest to the tree by the stream where he had eaten earlier. The sword felt heavy but right in his hands, a weight that carried both danger and hope.</p>

<p>Sitting back on the branch, he glanced at the stream below, eyes scanning the shadows. Today was luck, but from here on… it's skill, cunning, and courage. And I need all three.</p>

<p>Days turned into nights, nights into weeks, and Asahi's life in Ironfang Woods became a relentless rhythm of survival and training.</p>

<p>He leapt from branch to branch, spear in hand, feeling the forest pulse around him. Every snap of twigs, every whisper of the wind, every rustle of leaves taught him to move faster, strike sharper, and think quicker. Sometimes he miscalculated a jump and went crashing into a bush.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Stupid branch!" he yelled, brushing leaves and dirt off his head.</p>

<p>Why do I always land in the thorny ones?!</p>

<p>He fished tirelessly in the streams, often failing spectacularly. Fish slipped past his grasp, or he fell in with a loud splash.</p>

<p>"You little slippery devils!" he shouted, flailing wildly, half-submerged while the fish swam away unimpressed.</p>

<p>Eventually, after countless tries and wet, muddy clothes, he speared one perfectly and cooked it over a small fire he built himself. Smoke curled lazily upward, and he munched the fish with the triumphant expression of a boy who had survived the week.</p>

<p>Training was grueling but sometimes amusing. He practiced Fire Thrusts until the tip of his spear glowed steadily red with magic. Sparks flew with every strike, bark from trees charred and scattered. One swing sent a squirrel squeaking and jumping away in panic.</p>

<p>Then he discovered the Fire Swing, a wide, arcing attack that left streaks of flame in its path. Whoosh! Sizzle!</p>

<p>"Note to self," he muttered, "don't aim the Fire Swing at your own head again."</p>

<p>Monsters became relentless teachers. Spiders lunged from branches, snakes struck from the underbrush, and packs of goblins tried to corner him. Thud! Snap! Skree! Hiss! Every encounter honed his reflexes, every narrow escape sharpened his mind. He learned to dodge, anticipate attacks, strike with precision, and retreat when survival demanded it.</p>

<p>He even developed a habit of growling and screaming random insults at monsters when terrified, which occasionally confused his enemies—and himself.</p>

<p>This forest is insane… but I'm learning. I'm getting stronger. Faster. Smarter, he thought, leaping across branches with fluid grace, spear glowing at the ready.</p>

<p>Sometimes his own clumsiness got the better of him. He tripped over roots, fell headfirst into puddles, and once accidentally smacked a tree so hard he bounced off like a rubber ball.</p>

<p>"Oof! Seriously, Asahi, get your life together!" he muttered, water dripping from his hair, mud caking his clothes.</p>

<p>Every night, as he ate his meager catch and tended to his few possessions, he reflected on the ordeal.</p>

<p>Thirty days of running, fighting, starving, and surviving in Ironfang Woods… I've changed. I can feel it. My Fire Thrust hits harder, my Fire Swing arcs cleaner, and my movements… smoother, quicker, sharper. I survived Ironfang Woods for thirty days. That's… something.</p>

<p>He glanced around at the shadows stretching between the trees, feeling both exhausted and exhilarated. Every branch he leapt from, every monster he dodged, every fire-lit swing of his spear was proof: he was no longer the helpless boy who had trembled in the face of a kobold.</p>

<div class="narrator">Experience alone is not enough; it must be tempered by repetition, reflection, and constant testing. In Ironfang Woods, Asahi learned all of that the hard way. Every monster faced, every scratch and bruise endured, every narrow escape forged him into someone who could survive where others would fall. The forest was alive with danger at every turn, but it also sharpened his instincts, strengthened his body, and forced him to expand his mind. Even when clumsiness or bad luck sent him crashing into thorns, puddles, or startled squirrels, he adapted and improved. What he had once thought impossible—a boy with a weak body and little magic surviving among deadly predators—had become his reality. Yet, even with his newfound strength and skills, Ironfang Woods still held horrors beyond imagination, and the true trials were only just beginning.</div>
