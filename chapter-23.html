<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 23 – IMPRESSIVE FEAT</div>

<p>Asahi tightened his grip, taking a deep breath. Better be safe. Augment my eyes to the max.</p>

<p>The commoner don let out a roar and lunged at full speed, every ounce of his Level Three augment strength focused on that single strike. "Let's see if you can withstand my full power!"</p>

<p>Steel met steel in a blinding flash of light. Asahi barely managed to block the strike, every muscle screaming, every nerve on fire. He felt the raw force of the blow ripple through him, the shock sending him staggering backward. If I hadn't augmented my eyes, I'd be a smear on the floor right now…</p>

<p>Even with his eyes fully augmented, he hadn't boosted his body, and the recoil shook him violently. He gritted his teeth, trying to steady his stance.</p>

<p>From the sidelines, the spectators' reactions were immediate. The commoners whispered in disbelief.</p>

<p>"There's no way he survived that!"</p>

<p>"Impossible… he couldn't even see that coming fully…"</p>

<p>The nobles murmured among themselves, faces pale, voices low.</p>

<p>"Did he… block it?"</p>

<p>"No… he's dead for sure…"</p>

<p>"Who is this guy?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the secret spectators, invisible and silent to everyone else, chuckled softly.</p>

<p>"No, that was blocked just in the nick of time. Of course he survived," one whispered, shaking his head in disbelief, keeping the explanation well out of hearing range of the students.</p>

<p>The nobility don, standing slightly apart from the crowd, smirked but wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead. Huh… he actually managed to block it. Barely, but still… impressive.</p>

<p>Sasaki, on the other hand, had his hands over his mouth, trembling violently. "O-oh gods… he's still alive… barely… I think I need therapy…"</p>

<p>Asahi's chest heaved as he took a steadying step forward. Alright… that was just the opening.</p>

<p>Asahi's legs trembled slightly from the force of the previous strike, but he steadied himself, taking a deep breath. No holding back now.</p>

<p>The commoner don, still glowing in his magnificent Level Three form, stepped back slightly, his eyes widening. "I… I can't believe it. You actually managed to block that…"</p>

<p>He gave Asahi a slight bow, a subtle but clear gesture of respect. "From now on, I'll fight at my absolute maximum. No holding back."</p>

<p>Asahi nodded, tightening his grip on his sword. Alright. Time to show him what I've really got.</p>

<p>He felt his magic coursing through him, flames of power igniting in every limb. With Lisa's magic circle replenishing his reserve faster than it burned, he could afford to be generous with his attacks. His entire body glowed faintly, energy coiling around him like living threads.</p>

<p>"Since you're going all out," he said, voice firm, "I will too."</p>

<p>Then they dashed simultaneously, their movements a blur far too fast for the normal students to follow. Steel and energy streaked through the air as they closed in on each other.</p>

<p>The normal students could only gape, some murmuring anxiously.</p>

<p>"W-what… did they just move?!"</p>

<p>"That's not human speed…"</p>

<p>"Impossible… they're going to kill each other!"</p>

<p>Even some of the more composed nobles whispered to each other, eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Level Three and… what's he doing?!"</p>

<p>"He's keeping up?!"</p>

<p>The spectators, invisible to everyone, shook their heads in awe.</p>

<p>"No one else has moved like that since the last Level Three duel," one said, voice low. "And he's matching it… perfectly."</p>

<p>The nobility don's smirk turned into an awed grin, sweat dripping down his temple. He's really something else… even I didn't expect him to move like that.</p>

<p>Sasaki, behind a wall of mannequins, had collapsed to the floor, hands clutching his head. "O-oh gods… my heart… I can't… I can't watch this…"</p>

<p>The battlefield was set. Two blindingly fast forces collided, each strike a perfectly honed test of skill and magic, leaving everyone watching—both seen and unseen—utterly speechless.</p>

<p>Asahi's mind raced with every strike and parry. Top five really means top five. This guy could probably clear the fourth layer without breaking a sweat.</p>

<p>But he wasn't about to lose either. Every movement was precise, every strike refined to near perfection, countering Kenzo's full-power augment mode with nothing but efficiency and his own magic-imbued weapon.</p>

<p>The battle raged on, sparks and energy streaking across the classroom. Both fighters were moving faster than any ordinary eye could follow, each one anticipating the other's next move with uncanny accuracy.</p>

<p>Finally, Asahi saw an opening. Channeling everything into a single, explosive strike, he unleashed a fire thrust that sent a shockwave through the air. The force ripped Kenzo's sword from his grip, sending it skidding across the floor.</p>

<p>Asahi stepped forward, sword pressed lightly against Kenzo's neck. Both were breathing hard, sweat glistening on their faces, chests heaving from the exertion.</p>

<p>The entire room froze. The students, the nobles, even the secret spectators—all were utterly shocked.</p>

<p>"No way…"</p>

<p>"He actually defeated Kenzo?"</p>

<p>"That's… insane…"</p>

<p>Kenzo's eyes widened in surprise for the first time, staring at Asahi with a mixture of disbelief and respect. Asahi, still catching his breath, met his gaze with the same admiration.</p>

<p>Then, slowly, both of them smiled. Without a word, they shook hands firmly, the gesture carrying a weight of mutual recognition.</p>

<p>The audience was dumbfounded. Murmurs ran through both the commoners and nobles alike.</p>

<p>"They're… shaking hands?!"</p>

<p>"After all that… they're shaking hands?!"</p>

<p>"It's… respect…?"</p>

<p>Even the secret spectators exchanged impressed glances, acknowledging the rare moment of true camaraderie between two extraordinary fighters.</p>

<p>Asahi stepped back, lowering his sword, a small, satisfied grin on his face. He's strong… really strong.</p>

<p>Kenzo nodded once, still smiling. "You've got my respect, special student."</p>

<p>The tension in the room slowly melted, replaced by a mixture of awe, excitement, and disbelief at what they had just witnessed.</p>

<p>Kenzo straightened, sheathing his sword, and gave a small, respectful bow. "I'm Kenzo," he said simply. Since he was a commoner, that was all he needed, no family name required.</p>

<p>The crowd murmured quietly among themselves, but no one seemed surprised. Everyone already knew Kenzo was a commoner, yet they still respected him for his skill.</p>

<p>The nobility don stepped forward, giving a slight bow. "I'm Ryuunosuke Albrin, also called the Crimson Lion," he said, his voice calm but carrying authority. Asahi quickly returned the bow, introducing himself properly.</p>

<p>All around, the other students watched in awe. Some were still muttering about how they had just witnessed two of the top five students in a duel, and now they were casually introducing themselves like it was nothing.</p>

<p>The nobility don turned to Kenzo. "Why didn't you go for Level Four?"</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened internally. Level Four? Another power? And here I thought he was giving it his all…</p>

<p>Kenzo crossed his arms, shaking his head with a wry grin. "Level Four? Are you kidding? I go berserk in that state. I'll end up killing everyone around me. Level Three is still my practical max."</p>

<p>He glanced at Asahi and raised an eyebrow. "Though I assume you probably had something up your sleeve too, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Asahi scratched the back of his head and gave a silly grin. "Well… yeah."</p>

<p>Can't let them know that was my absolute max…</p>

<p>In his mind, he couldn't help but think: These two are absolute freaks… I swear, who even exists like this?</p>

<p>Around them, whispers and quiet exclamations ran through the crowd. Students' faces were a mix of awe and disbelief. Some muttered, "Top five? No… top five is too small a label for them…" Others shook their heads, muttering, "They're freaks… absolute freaks…"</p>

<p>Sasaki, peeking from the side, had his hands over his face, peeking through his fingers. "I… I can't survive another day here…" he muttered, voice trembling.</p>

<p>Asahi looked at Kenzo and Ryuunosuke, then back at the crowd, letting out a small laugh. Alright… maybe this school isn't as impossible as it seems… but these two are insane.</p>

<p>Kenzo sheathed his sword and gave Asahi a respectful nod. "I came here to size you up. Seems I misjudged you. My apologies."</p>

<p>Ryuunosuke, the Crimson Lion, smirked and bowed lightly. "Likewise. It appears you're stronger than expected"</p>

<p>Their respective gangs followed them out, leaving the classroom slowly emptying. Asahi watched the students depart, noticing that only around six remained. The rest either had no intention of joining in the first place or had been too intimidated to stay after seeing him stand toe-to-toe with two of the top five students.</p>

<p>Among the remaining students, Asahi spotted the redhead he had met during supper. She gave him a cheerful wave and a warm smile. He returned it, a small sense of relief washing over him.</p>

<p>Later, in the headmaster's office, Toshiko gazed into a crystal orb, the events of the classroom playing out within it. She let out a soft chuckle. "Well… this kid sure knows how to make waves. Reminds me of a certain witch."</p>
