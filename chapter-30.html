<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 30 – REGISTRATION</div>

<p>"Next, please," she said.</p>

<p>Sasaki shuffled forward nervously. "Uh… Sasaki Bitralis. First-year… I'd like to register as an adventurer."</p>

<p>The clerk nodded politely. "Understood. And your current academy rank?"</p>

<p>"Tenth," he said softly, eyes flicking to Asahi.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, jotting it down. "Registration accepted."</p>

<p>Akari stepped up next. "Akari," she said plainly.</p>

<p>"Rank?" the clerk asked.</p>

<p>"Sixth," Akari replied, her tone calm and confident.</p>

<p>The clerk wrote it down quickly. "Accepted. Next?"</p>

<p>Asahi stepped forward, suddenly feeling very small. "Uh… Asahi. No surname."</p>

<p>The clerk's pen hovered for a moment. "And your rank in the academy?"</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, gulped, and glanced at Akari and Sasaki. Oh no, here it comes.</p>

<p>"D… no—uh…" he stammered.</p>

<p>Akari sighed softly. "He's not ranked yet, remember?"</p>

<p>Sasaki muttered, "Y-yeah, still waiting on some results…"</p>

<p>The clerk nodded slowly, as if expecting this. "Understood. Registration complete for all three of you. You may now access the guild and view available missions."</p>

<p>Asahi exhaled, relief washing over him. "Finally… done."</p>

<p>Akari crossed her arms. "You make it sound like surviving a dragon fight."</p>

<p>Sasaki smiled faintly. "It's… kind of like that."</p>

<p>The clerk set down her quill and looked at the three of them with a calm, professional expression. "Very well, your registration is complete. Please proceed to Room Seven. Wait there for your appraiser—he will evaluate your abilities and determine your official rank within the guild."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, a mix of curiosity and nervousness stirring in his chest. "Appraiser?" he muttered.</p>

<p>Akari's lips curved into a small, knowing smirk. "Sounds like your moment to finally prove yourself, country bumpkin."</p>

<p>Sasaki shuffled his feet, glancing at Asahi. "Y-yeah… don't worry. It's just an evaluation. You'll be fine."</p>

<p>Asahi sighed and ran a hand through his hair. Fine, huh… we'll see about that.</p>

<p>With that, the three of them turned and walked down the hall toward Room Seven, the quiet murmur of the guild filling the air around them.</p>

<p>The three of them sat on a worn leather couch in Room Seven, the walls lined with shelves full of magical trinkets and old guild scrolls. The faint hum of enchanted lanterns filled the silence.</p>

<p>Asahi fidgeted with his hands, glancing between Akari and Sasaki. "Wait… I still don't get it. How come I was allowed to register? I thought only the top twenty students could join."</p>

<p>Akari leaned back, crossing her arms and giving him a measured look. "Top twenty students are allowed to bring up to two unranked students with them as support," she explained. "It's meant for apprentices, assistants… people they think have potential. But whether you actually get a guild rank depends entirely on your abilities."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened. "So I'm… basically riding on your coattails?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," Akari said, her voice calm but firm. "We're still only half-members. You, Sasaki, and I have to pass the following tests to become active members. That's when the guild will officially recognize our rank."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded quietly. "Y-yeah… you'll have a chance to prove yourself, Asahi. Just… try not to mess up too badly."</p>

<p>Asahi let out a long breath, leaning back into the couch. Half-members, huh? So this is really just the start… He couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement. "Alright… I get it now. Guess I'd better not waste this chance."</p>

<p>Akari smirked. "Good. That's the attitude you need if you want to survive this place."</p>

<p>Asahi frowned, leaning forward slightly. "Wait… then how come you didn't even question Akari being sixth or Sasaki being tenth? Isn't that kind of… unbelievable?"</p>

<p>Akari let out a soft laugh. "No one would dare walk into the guild wearing these uniforms and pretend to be ranked. The moment you try something like that, everyone notices."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded shyly. "Y-yeah… the guild is thorough. They check records, histories, everything. If someone doesn't actually match their claimed rank, their registration gets terminated immediately."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. So… they're not just trusting us because we're flashy first-years. They actually know what they're doing.</p>

<p>Akari's smirk widened slightly. "Exactly. Our ranks aren't given lightly. But since we're legitimate top-ten students, the guild accepted us without question. Everyone here knows the risk is too high to fake it."</p>

<p>Asahi rubbed his chin, a small grin forming. "Huh… I see. So it's kind of like a built-in safety net for cheaters, huh?"</p>

<p>Sasaki chuckled softly, glancing down at his hands. "I guess you could say that…"</p>

<p>Asahi leaned back, letting the tension ease slightly. Alright… half-members, safety nets, thorough checks… sounds complicated. But it also sounds… exciting.</p>

<p>The door to Room Seven swung open with a sharp creak, and a tall man in a dark cloak stepped inside. His eyes scanned the three students carefully, settling briefly on each of them before he spoke in a deep, measured tone.</p>

<p>"I am your examiner," he began, voice carrying easily through the room. "Your evaluation will consist of three parts. First, a written test. It will measure your knowledge of magic theory, alchemy, combat strategy, and the fundamental rules of adventuring. Accuracy and efficiency are key."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened slightly. Written test? I didn't expect this to be a school exam all over again… but I guess knowing my stuff matters even here.</p>

<p>The examiner continued, "Second, a combat trial. You will face controlled opponents in a simulated environment. This is to assess reflexes, decision-making, and your ability to apply elemental control under pressure."</p>

<p>Akari leaned back slightly, a faint glint of excitement in her eyes. Now this is more interesting. A real test of skill. Finally, something that actually matters instead of just paper.</p>

<p>"And finally," the examiner said, "a practical combat session with monsters of varying levels. You will be evaluated not just on strength, but on strategy, adaptability, and teamwork. The higher the level of monster you can overcome effectively, the higher your potential guild rank will be."</p>

<p>Sasaki's hands twisted nervously in his lap. M-monsters? Real monsters? Oh no… don't mess up, don't mess up, don't mess up…</p>

<p>Asahi let out a long breath, trying to steady himself. Alright… a written test, a combat trial, and monsters… I can handle this. I just need to keep my focus and think ahead. I've come this far, haven't I?</p>

<p>Akari tilted her head, smirking. "Well… that last part sounds fun. Let's see how much they've really prepared us for this."</p>

<p>Sasaki gave a small nod, his usual shy smile appearing. "I'll try my best… I just hope I don't slow anyone down."</p>

<p>The examiner's gaze swept over them once more. "You will have separate schedules for each trial. Pass all three, and you will be granted full membership and your initial guild rank. Fail any one of them, and your registration may be revoked. Understood?"</p>

<p>The three exchanged glances.</p>

<p>Asahi muttered under his breath, Revoked registration… no pressure at all.</p>

<p>Akari's smirk widened. "Understood. Let's get this over with."</p>

<p>Sasaki's voice was barely audible. "Y-yes… we'll do our best."</p>

<p>The examiner reached into a satchel at his side and pulled out three thick bundles of parchment, each tied neatly with a ribbon. He placed one in front of each student.</p>

<p>"These are your study materials," he said, voice steady. "They cover all topics relevant to the written test: magic theory, elemental control, alchemy basics, combat strategies, and adventuring rules. You will have two hours to review before the test begins."</p>

<p>Asahi picked up the bundle, feeling the weight of it in his hands. Two hours… that's not much, but I can do this. I just need to focus.</p>

<p>Akari flipped through her stack quickly, scanning a few pages with practiced ease. All this theory… it's straightforward. The real challenge is applying it. Still, best get a solid grip on it before the test starts.</p>

<p>Sasaki held his bundle close, shuffling his feet nervously. I-I'll try… I hope I can remember everything… maybe I should start with the basics first…</p>

<p>The examiner's gaze swept over them again. "Do not attempt to access outside help. The test will be monitored. Two hours. Begin your preparation now."</p>

<p>Asahi exhaled slowly, rolling his shoulders. "Alright… time to cram like my life depends on it."</p>

<p>Akari smirked slightly, settling in. "Two hours. Enough to get ready… just don't waste it on panicking."</p>

<p>Sasaki muttered softly, almost to himself, "I-I'll do my best…"</p>

<p>The three spread the parchment across the table, the quiet shuffle of papers and the scratching of notes filling the small room as the countdown to their first trial began.</p>
