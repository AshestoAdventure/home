<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 39 – IT STARTS.</div>

<p>In a faraway land, the air shimmered with heat and ash. Lisa was on one knee, panting, her arm clutching her side where blood soaked through her uniform. The ground around her was scorched, cracked from the sheer force of the battle.</p>

<p>From the shadows ahead, a tall silhouette emerged, eyes glowing faintly, voice deep and calm. "Since you've regained this much strength," Lisa rasped, forcing herself to stand, "the seal must be weakening."</p>

<p>The figure tilted its head, almost amused. "Good observation," it replied coolly. "But the dead have no need for information."</p>

<p>Lisa wiped the blood from her lip, her smirk cutting through the pain. "Underestimating me won't do you much good."</p>

<p>A flash of light cracked the air and the two clashed, the explosion of energy lighting up the ruined valley.</p>

<p>The next morning, the academy grounds were alive with tension. The grand tournament was a day away, and every participant could feel it. Conversations were hushed, eyes sharp. The weak avoided the gaze of the strong, and the strong measured their rivals with silent challenge.</p>

<p>Asahi, Akari, and Sasaki stood among them — each feeling the weight of what was coming. The calm before the storm.</p>

<p>The morning sun bathed the academy gardens in a warm glow. Students passed by in groups, whispering about their possible opponents, but Asahi, Akari, and Sasaki had claimed a quiet spot under a large tree near the fountain.</p>

<p>Sasaki was lazily leaning back on the grass, chewing on a piece of candy. "Man, everyone's so tense today. You'd think the tournament was life or death or something."</p>

<p>Akari smiled faintly, her eyes scanning the training fields in the distance. "For some of them, it kind of is. This tournament decides rankings, scholarships, and even which teams get sponsored by guilds."</p>

<p>Asahi sighed, fiddling with a blade of grass. "You two sound way too calm for people about to face bloodthirsty monsters in human form."</p>

<p>Sasaki grinned. "That's 'cause we've been through it once already, big bro."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Akari added with a smirk. "We made it to the top ten last time, remember? This year, we're aiming higher."</p>

<p>"Top five," Sasaki said confidently, raising a fist.</p>

<p>Asahi chuckled. "Top five, huh? Ambitious. Guess I'll have to make sure I don't embarrass myself next to you guys."</p>

<p>Akari turned to him curiously. "Speaking of that… you got something up your sleeve for Haruto?"</p>

<p>Asahi hesitated, a sly smile tugging at his lips. "Maybe a few tricks. What about you two?"</p>

<p>"Same as always," Sasaki said. "Fight smart, don't die."</p>

<p>"Fight smart," Akari echoed with a laugh. "And make sure he doesn't die."</p>

<p>In the dimly lit headmaster's office, the only sound was the slow ticking of the old clock on the wall. Papers were neatly stacked on her desk, and the faint scent of burning incense filled the air.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the shadows at the edge of the room rippled—and a cloaked figure emerged, dropping to one knee.</p>

<p>"Speak," the headmaster said without looking up from her documents.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," the spy replied, his voice low and steady. "All the preparations have been made. Tomorrow, His Majesty and the Captain of the Royal Knights will be attending the tournament."</p>

<p>The headmaster finally looked up, a faint glint of curiosity in her eyes. "This kind of thing has never happened before. What excuse does His Majesty have up his sleeve this time?"</p>

<p>"The official reason," the spy said, "is that His Majesty wishes to witness his son's final tournament before he graduates. As for the Captain—he will be attending as the King's bodyguard."</p>

<p>The headmaster chuckled softly, resting her chin on her hand. "A bodyguard? For him? That's rich. As if anyone in this kingdom could even touch the King."</p>

<p>Her tone shifted as she straightened her posture. "Very well. Everything is ready on our end too. Lisa will arrive tomorrow. She's taken care of one of the envoys."</p>

<p>The spy's head lifted slightly, surprise flickering across his face. "That is… wonderful news. I'll inform His Majesty right away."</p>

<p>The headmaster's gaze softened for a moment, but her next words carried a faint edge. "She did win… but—"</p>

<p>The spy froze, eyes widening slightly.</p>

<p>"That will be all."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>And with that, the spy vanished as swiftly as he had appeared, leaving only the faint shimmer of displaced air behind him, and the headmaster staring silently out the window, her thoughts far away.</p>

<p>Inside the royal chamber, the King's voice echoed sharply across the hall.</p>

<p>"Lisa has been heavily wounded by just one envoy, you say?!"</p>

<p>The spy, kneeling low before him, nodded. "Yes, Your Majesty. However, the envoy was slain. Lady Lisa emerged victorious, though she sustained significant injuries."</p>

<p>The King's expression hardened, his hand tightening around the armrest of his throne. "So she killed it… yet still suffered that much?" He let out a slow, tense breath. "Then the envoys truly are growing stronger."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, standing at his side, spoke cautiously. "Should we reconsider tomorrow's plans, Your Majesty? Perhaps postpone the tournament—"</p>

<p>"Absolutely not," the King interrupted, his tone firm. "If we show fear now, they'll know we're vulnerable. The tournament will continue."</p>

<p>He stood up, his regal presence filling the room. "But double the security. Have the royal knights on standby at all times. If the envoys dare show their faces again…" His eyes narrowed, a faint glint of fury in them. "They won't be leaving alive."</p>

<p>The spy bowed deeply. "Understood, Your Majesty."</p>

<p>As he vanished into the shadows, the King turned toward the window, gazing at the kingdom beyond.</p>

<p>"Lisa managed to slay one," he murmured. "But if that was just the beginning… we may be facing something far worse soon."</p>

<p>Asahi lay on his bed staring at the ceiling. The tournament lasts three days… first day's just qualifiers for everyone except the top twenty and special students. The second day's when things get real — qualifiers face the ranked students and the special ones. Then the third day should be the semis and finals.</p>

<p>But how are they even gonna make it fair? I mean, if someone like Haruto ends up fighting a weakling in the first round, that's just bullying. Hmm… maybe they'll do some kind of scoring system instead of straight eliminations — like short timed matches where the judges rate performance, not just who wins. That way, even if someone loses against a top guy but still puts up a fight, they can rank higher.</p>

<p>Then, once the scores are set, maybe the top few get seeded into the main bracket — so the strongest only meet at the end. Yeah… that'd keep things fast and fair. Guess I'll just have to make every second count when it's my turn.</p>

<p>The academy was buzzing like a beehive. Everywhere Asahi went, students were whispering excitedly.</p>

<p>"Did you hear? The king himself is coming tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"And the Captain of the Royal Knights too! What's going on?"</p>

<p>Rumors spread like wildfire — some said the king was here to watch his son's final tournament, others whispered that something huge was about to happen. Even the teachers looked unusually tense, pretending not to eavesdrop on the students' chatter.</p>

<p>Asahi just sighed, sipping his drink in the cafeteria. "Great," he muttered. "As if things weren't intense enough already."</p>

<p>The morning sun glimmered over the grand stadium, its golden rays bouncing off banners and flags that fluttered proudly in the wind. The air was electric — nobles in their finest robes filled the royal stands, while commoners packed the seats below, shouting and cheering. Magic drones hovered above to broadcast the event across the capital.</p>

<p>Backstage, the roar of the crowd echoed faintly through the walls. Asahi, Akari, and Sasaki stood together, all dressed in their battle gear, faces lit with a mix of nerves and determination.</p>

<p>Akari smiled softly. "We've come a long way, huh?"</p>

<p>Sasaki grinned, adjusting his glasses. "Let's make sure everyone remembers our names this time."</p>

<p>Asahi chuckled and raised his fist. "Top five?"</p>

<p>The other two mirrored him, their fists meeting in the middle.</p>

<p>"Top five!" they said together, grinning like idiots. For a brief moment, the noise outside faded away — it was just the three of them, standing side by side like always.</p>

<p>Then the announcer's voice boomed through the arena: "Participants, prepare to enter the stage!"</p>

<p>Asahi took a deep breath. "Guess it's showtime."</p>
