<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 6 – A NEW MAN</div>

<p>The sun filtered weakly through the thick canopy of Ironfang Woods, and the forest was alive with its usual chorus of chirps, rustles, and distant growls. But today, a peculiar sound echoed through the trees. It wasn't the hiss of a snake or the skitter of a spider.</p>

<p>It was squeaks. Lots of squeaks.</p>

<p>A tribe of kobolds, twenty strong, had gathered in a small clearing. They chattered furiously among themselves, their high-pitched voices overlapping into a comical chaos.</p>

<p>"Squeee! Squee-squee-squeak!" one barked, waving its tiny rusty dagger like a conductor's baton.</p>

<p>"Squeeek! Squeee-squee!" another shouted back, stomping its little clawed foot as if making the most important point in kobold history.</p>

<p>Soon, all twenty of them were at it, squeaking, squealing, squabbling, like a choir of deranged rubber ducks. A few were gesturing wildly, others were tugging at each other's tails, and one particularly energetic kobold kept falling over mid-squeak and scrambling back up to rejoin the argument.</p>

<p>The forest itself seemed to pause, as if listening to this ridiculous debate. Birds went silent, even the wind hushed, letting the chorus of squeaky nonsense fill the clearing.</p>

<p>"I DECLARE WAR!"</p>

<p>Asahi came crashing down from the trees, landing with a triumphant grin and pointing his sword dramatically at the horde of kobolds. His voice thundered across the clearing, echoing through the forest like a battle cry of destiny.</p>

<p>The kobolds froze mid-squeak. Twenty pairs of beady eyes turned to him in stunned silence. One kobold still had its mouth wide open mid-squeal, but no sound came out. The moment was so absurd that even Asahi could not help but chuckle before shouting again, this time with even more gusto.</p>

<p>"YES, YOU HEARD ME! WAR!"</p>

<p>The morning light glinted off Asahi's sword, no longer the half-rusted thing he had stumbled upon weeks ago. Its blade was sharp and gleaming, carefully polished until it shone like a mirror. Even the hilt looked proper now, cleaned and wrapped tight with strips of cloth to make gripping it easier. It wasn't just a weapon anymore—it was his companion, his pride, and the one thing standing between him and a grisly end in Ironfang Woods.</p>

<p>His outfit was no longer the tattered, dirt-caked clothes he had escaped the village with. Instead, he wore the scavenged leather armor he had taken from that fallen adventurer. The chest piece was scratched and scuffed, the boots looked like they had marched through hell and back, and the pouch at his hip still had a faint tear along the side. But together, they made him look like an actual fighter instead of a boy pretending to be one.</p>

<p>Strapped across his back were his secondary weapons. The old rusty sword and dagger, both useless on their own, had been lashed together into a makeshift spear. He had carefully bound the dagger's blade to the tip, replacing the crude stone point with metal. The result wasn't pretty, but it was functional, a jagged-tipped weapon with just enough bite to pierce scales or fur if his main sword ever failed him.</p>

<p>And so he stood there, leather creaking softly as he shifted his stance, the polished sword in his hands and his improvised spear across his back. For the first time since everything began, Asahi looked less like a boy stumbling through the woods and more like a budding adventurer.</p>

<p>The kobolds blinked in disbelief at first, staring at the human boy who had so boldly declared war. Then, with squeaks and yips that echoed through the trees, the entire pack of twenty rushed him in a chaotic swarm.</p>

<p>"Alright, let's do this!" Asahi shouted, tightening his grip on the gleaming sword.</p>

<p>The first kobold leapt forward, dagger raised. Steel met steel with a sharp clang, and Asahi shoved it back before slashing across its chest. Another came at him from the side, but he twisted just in time, blade flashing as it cut the creature down. His movements were faster than they had been weeks ago. His training was paying off.</p>

<p>But soon, he realized just how many there were. The rustle of bodies, the scrape of blades, the squeaky snarls filled the air as kobolds circled around him.</p>

<p>"Tch! You little pests are everywhere! Surrounding me like this, so unfair!"</p>

<p>With his back nearly against the trees, Asahi's frustration boiled over. He raised his sword, magic sparking faintly along the blade.</p>

<p>"Fine then… FIRE SWING!"</p>

<p>He slashed downward, and a brilliant red crescent of energy erupted from the sword's edge, trailing sparks and leaving a fiery streak in the air. It smashed into the mob, sending three kobolds tumbling to the ground, scorched and squealing.</p>

<p>The survivors hesitated, but Asahi was not done.</p>

<p>"One more! FIRE SWING!"</p>

<p>Another blazing arc carved through the air, this one wider and fiercer, cutting down four more kobolds at once. The smell of charred fur filled the forest, and the survivors squeaked in panic.</p>

<p>Asahi staggered slightly, sweat running down his face.</p>

<p>"Hah… this is bad. My magic's… running out already."</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth, forcing himself to stand tall as the remaining kobolds snarled and closed in. He shifted his stance, eyes sharp.</p>

<p>"Alright then. FIRE THRUST!"</p>

<p>He lunged forward, the tip of his sword glowing hot like a bullet of flame, and it pierced straight through a kobold's skull. Sparks flew as the energy detonated inside, dropping the creature instantly.</p>

<p>"FIRE THRUST!" he shouted again, this time punching through the chest of another kobold with brutal force, sending it sprawling lifeless onto the dirt.</p>

<p>When three tried to attack at once, Asahi swung his improvised spear from his back, hurling it with all his strength. The weapon spun through the air before skewering two kobolds in one strike, both of them collapsing with strangled squeaks.</p>

<p>The last one charged, but Asahi sidestepped and drove his sword straight into its gut before pulling free, panting heavily.</p>

<p>All around him, the clearing was littered with the small twisted bodies of kobolds, some scorched, some skewered, and some cut down by sheer steel. Asahi stood among them, chest heaving, sweat dripping, his polished sword glowing faintly red before finally dimming.</p>

<div class="narrator">Magic in this world is not a bottomless well. It is tied directly to the lifeforce of the one who wields it. The stronger the body, the greater the pool to draw from. But to overreach, to demand more than the body can safely give, leads to crushing fatigue, unconsciousness, and in the worst cases, death itself. That is why even the strongest adventurers pace themselves in battle, striking with steel when possible and saving their magic for decisive moments. Asahi had learned this the hard way in his reckless clash against the kobold tribe. He survived, yes, but each drop of sweat rolling down his cheek was a reminder that his victories could cost him his very life if he did not balance strength with restraint.</div>

<p>Asahi sat near the stream, his boots soaked slightly in the cool water. Smoke from the small fire he had used to cook his fish drifted lazily into the air, carrying the faint smell of charred scales. He chewed thoughtfully, glancing at the polished sword lying across his knees, and then at the makeshift spear strapped across his back.</p>

<p>"Hah… that was too close," he muttered, swallowing the last bite. "If two of those Fire Swings took out sixty percent of my energy, what happens if a bigger monster notices me? I'd be done before I even blink."</p>

<p>He leaned back on his hands, staring at the rippling surface of the stream, trying to think. Magic isn't endless. I can't just blast everything in my way. But… if I save it, my normal attacks won't be strong enough. What do I do then?</p>

<p>"Maybe… I could use normal swings until I really need magic," he said aloud, tapping the blade lightly against the ground. "But what if I misjudge? What if they're stronger than I expect?"</p>

<p>His mind raced. I can't just use Fire Swings for everything. I can't even afford a Fire Thrust unless it counts. But if I don't use magic, I'll never defeat strong enemies. And if I use it too much, I'll be drained before I even survive the first attack.</p>

<p>He rubbed his forehead, frustration clear in his voice. "So… do I save magic and hit weakly? Or burn it and risk running out too soon? Or… or maybe I can time it somehow… but how?"</p>

<p>Thoughts collided in his head, tumbling over each other like stones down a cliff. If I go slow, I might survive… but then I won't defeat anything. If I go fast, I could kill the enemy but… I'd be dead right after. How do I even decide when to use magic without wasting it?</p>

<p>He stared at the sword, the spear, and the forest beyond, his mind whirling. "I got it… maybe? No… wait… ugh!"</p>

<p>Then, out of the corner of his eye, something small caught his attention. A tiny insect was struggling to carry a heavy crumb across a twig. It moved slowly, pausing, adjusting its grip, testing the weight, and then inching forward again. Every time it faltered, it corrected, learning the exact way to handle the burden.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened as realization struck him. It's timing… efficiency… precision… I don't need to blast everything with full power. I just need to use my magic at the exact right moment, just enough to finish the job without wasting energy.</p>

<p>He jumped up, eyes bright and sharp, sword in hand. "I got it!"</p>

<p>The forest seemed to pulse with possibility, echoing his excitement. He had no clue if it would work in practice, but for the first time, a strategy flickered in his mind, fragile but real.</p>
