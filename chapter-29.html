<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 29 – THE ADVENTURERS' GUILD</div>

<p>The sky above the village burned orange as flames licked at the rooftops. Smoke twisted and curled into the air, stinging Asahi's eyes. He sprinted through the narrow street, boots pounding against the stone, the terrified shouts of villagers echoing in every direction. Steel clashed in the distance, sharp cries puncturing the night.</p>

<p>An intruder lunged from the shadows with a jagged blade raised high. Asahi's hand moved faster than thought. His wooden practice sword was gone, replaced by steel. The blade sang as it cut through the air, meeting the attacker's strike. Sparks flared. His arms shook from the impact, but he pushed forward, teeth gritted. With a fierce shove, he sent the intruder stumbling, then spun and struck him across the chest. The man fell, gasping, before going still.</p>

<p>"Everyone, stay inside your homes!" Asahi shouted, his voice carrying down the road. "Do not open the doors for anyone!"</p>

<p>A mother clutched her child at the corner, trembling. "Please, save us!"</p>

<p>"I will," Asahi said, breath heavy. "No one is getting through me."</p>

<p>He dashed forward again. A second intruder appeared, then a third, both snarling like wolves. Asahi raised his sword and fought. His movements were swift, sharper than he remembered ever being. Each swing carried weight and precision. His strikes rang out like the heartbeat of the village itself. He blocked, parried, and struck back. The clang of steel was everywhere, his arms aching, sweat dripping into his eyes, but he did not falter.</p>

<p>"You think you can burn my home?" he growled, cutting one intruder down with a decisive slash. "Not while I'm standing."</p>

<p>Another man rushed him with a spear. Asahi ducked low, his body moving before he even thought. He thrust his sword upward, catching the shaft and twisting it aside. In one motion, he stepped in close and slammed his shoulder into the man's chest, knocking him to the ground. The spear clattered away.</p>

<p>Then the earth trembled beneath his feet. A low rumble rolled across the burning village, deeper than thunder. Asahi's head snapped up just in time to see the eastern wall of the village collapse in an explosion of stone and dust. Through the smoke crawled a monstrous newt, its body glistening with wet scales, each one the size of a shield. Its golden eyes glowed with hunger, and its forked tongue lashed out, snapping a cart in two like kindling.</p>

<p>The villagers screamed. Roofs caved as the beast's tail swept across the street.</p>

<p>Asahi's stomach twisted, but he forced his legs to move. "No. Not again. I will not let this happen."</p>

<p>He sprinted toward the towering creature, his sword raised. Every step felt impossible, but his blood roared like fire in his veins. The newt lowered its massive head, jaws dripping with saliva that sizzled when it hit the burning ground. Its hiss rattled the air.</p>

<p>"Come on then!" Asahi shouted, his voice breaking with fury. "If you want this village, you'll have to take me first!"</p>

<p>The beast lunged, its mouth opening wide enough to swallow him whole. At the last second, Asahi rolled aside, the heat of its breath burning his cheek. He slashed at its leg, sparks flying as steel met scale. The strike left only a shallow cut, but the monster reared back, shrieking.</p>

<p>For a moment, Asahi almost believed he could fight it, almost believed that his blade could hold back the impossible.</p>

<p>But then a shadow passed over him. He turned and saw a massive figure cloaked in black, holding a blade as long as Asahi's height. The man's eyes glowed faintly beneath the hood. The ground seemed to shake when he stepped forward.</p>

<p>"You are in my way," the figure said in a voice like thunder.</p>

<p>Asahi's grip tightened on his sword. His heart pounded in his chest, but his feet did not move back. He planted himself firmly between the figure, the beast, and the frightened villagers behind him.</p>

<p>"If I fall, then so be it," Asahi whispered to himself, fire flashing in his eyes. "But I won't move aside. This is my home. These are my people."</p>

<p>The figure raised his blade, and Asahi raised his own to meet it. Behind them, the newt let out another earth-shaking roar. When steel struck steel, the world itself seemed to split apart.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes snapped open. His chest heaved as though he had been running for miles. The wooden beams of the dorm ceiling came into focus above him, blurred by the wetness in his eyes. For a long moment he just lay there, breath shallow, unable to move. His cheeks felt damp.</p>

<p>Slowly, he lifted a trembling hand to his face and wiped at the tears, then let his arm fall across his eyes, shutting the world out. The quiet of the room pressed in on him, broken only by the faint rustle of the night breeze slipping through the window.</p>

<p>"It was… just a dream," he whispered, voice unsteady. He let out a breath, long and heavy, as though the weight of the entire village had been pressing on his shoulders. His lips curved into the faintest, sad smile, though no one was there to see it.</p>

<p>"Mom… Dad…" His voice cracked, soft as the wind. He swallowed hard, his chest tightening. "…I'll keep moving forward. I'll make sure none of it was in vain."</p>

<p>The words lingered in the quiet, half a vow, half a prayer, before silence reclaimed the room.</p>

<p>The morning sun bathed the academy courtyard in a golden glow as Asahi finally made his way toward the front gate. Akari was already there, arms crossed, foot tapping against the stone tiles. The moment she spotted him, her sharp voice cut through the air.</p>

<p>"You're late!" she barked, eyes narrowing.</p>

<p>Sasaki, standing loyally beside her, instantly raised his hands in defense of his idol. "Big bro must've had important things to do! You can't just blame him for being a little slow!"</p>

<p>Akari rolled her eyes. "Important things, my foot."</p>

<p>Asahi gave a sheepish smile but said nothing, letting the two squabble as they began walking out together.</p>

<p>The pair of armored security knights standing at the gate stiffened the moment they noticed him approaching. Their gazes snapped forward like disciplined statues, and both subtly bowed their heads, lips moving in silent prayer. Please don't notice us… please don't notice us…</p>

<p>Asahi passed by without sparing them a glance. His steps were calm, almost regal. But in his head, his thoughts were far less serious.</p>

<p>Honestly, I have better things to do than waste time on some petty squabbles with guards. Let them stew in peace.</p>

<p>The corners of his mouth twitched as he fought back a chuckle, keeping his dignified facade intact.</p>

<p>________________________________________</p>

<p>The massive doors of the Adventurers Guild loomed ahead, carved from dark oak and inlaid with shining brass. Asahi's jaw dropped slightly. He had seen towns, marketplaces, even the occasional noble's manor—but nothing like this. The sheer size and the bustle of activity were overwhelming.</p>

<p>Akari's eyes sparkled as she glanced around. "This is where real adventurers get their assignments. Not just training in the academy, but actual missions across the country."</p>

<p>Sasaki's calm expression hid the excitement in his gaze. "Big bro Asahi… look at all of them. People coming in, leaving, posting requests. And the notice boards… so many chances to test ourselves out there."</p>

<p>Asahi's hands twitched slightly. He had grown up in a small village. He had never seen anything like this—guild clerks bustling behind counters, apprentices running messages, adventurers consulting massive maps and discussion boards filled with quests of every scale.</p>

<p>"So this is where we get sent out into the world?" he murmured, awe lacing his voice. "Not just to fight, but… to actually travel, help people, explore?"</p>

<p>Akari smirked. "Exactly. This is where you step out of the academy bubble. If you want real experience, real practice, this is it. And the missions aren't just for show—they actually affect towns, trade routes, even politics sometimes."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded eagerly. "Big bro Asahi… if you join here, you'll see the country in a way no classroom could ever teach. And you'll be helping people while you're at it."</p>

<p>Asahi let out a long breath, his heart pounding with a mix of excitement and nerves. The grandeur, the activity, the sense of purpose in the place—it was overwhelming. This… this is the real world waiting for me.</p>

<p>He straightened his shoulders and stepped forward. "Alright. Let's see what kind of missions are out there."</p>

<p>They stepped inside, and the sheer energy of the guild hit them immediately. People bustled across the polished floors, some carrying scrolls, others consulting large maps. Many of them were clearly seasoned adventurers, their armor and weapons gleaming, their presence radiating strength.</p>

<p>Almost instantly, dozens of eyes turned toward the trio. Asahi felt a prickle of awareness crawl up his spine. He leaned slightly toward Akari, murmuring under his breath. "Why… is everyone staring at us?"</p>

<p>Akari's smirk widened, and she shrugged casually. "Because they know. The moment they see students in this uniform, they know you're among the top twenty in the academy. Top twenty means you're dangerous, and no one wants to get on the bad side of someone that strong."</p>

<p>Sasaki's eyes gleamed as he glanced around, clearly proud. "Big bro Asahi… see? Just by showing up, people already take notice. That's how much respect—or fear—this uniform carries."</p>

<p>Asahi's lips pressed into a thin line as he walked forward, trying to ignore the weight of so many gazes. Top twenty, huh… so just wearing this means trouble—or respect. Funny how the two feel so similar.</p>
