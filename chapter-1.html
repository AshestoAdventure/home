<div class="narrator">This is a world where magic flows through the veins of every living being. Some people have it like an overflowing river, others like a leaky faucet, but the ironclad rule is this: everyone has it. And in a world where magic is currency, status, and law all rolled into one, those born with barely a drop are naturally looked down upon.</div>

<p>Asahi wakes with a jolt to the sound of his father hollering.</p>

<p>"Asahi! Hurry up n' wake up! The cows ain't gon' milk themselves!"</p>

<p>Still half-asleep, he rubs his eyes and stumbles to the back of the hut where the cows lazily chew on grass. Bucket in hand, he starts milking. Just as the rhythm sets in, squish. Something unpleasant wiggles under his bare foot. His eyes flick down. Fresh cow dung. Of course.</p>

<p>Asahi lets out a sigh so long and dramatic it could have won him an award.</p>

<p>Suddenly, noise erupts from the village square. People gather on both sides of the muddy road, gasping and whispering like they have just seen a god descend.</p>

<p>Rolling into view is a grand carriage, polished wood gleaming even under the dusty sun. A knight in shining armor sits at the front, reins in hand, face stoic enough to scare flies away. The carriage windows are shut tight, hiding whoever sits inside.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes follow it with quiet envy.</p>

<p>"Must be nice to be born into nobility. I wonder which family that belongs to."</p>

<p>He is so lost in thought that he does not notice the trail of dung he has smeared across the ground until</p>

<p>"Asahi! What is this mess?!" his mother yells.</p>

<p>He turns. Sure enough, the yard looks like a battlefield of stink.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I'll clean it right now!"</p>

<div class="narrator">Meanwhile, deep within the forest, a different gathering takes place. A circle of figures cloaked in scarlet robes, each with a strange mark stitched into their backs. Their presence feels heavy, like the air itself does not want to breathe near them.</div>

<p>One man asks in a low, commanding tone:</p>

<p>"Is it ready?"</p>

<p>A subordinate grins.</p>

<p>"Yes, boss. Tonight… there will be a bloodbath."</p>

<p>Their collective smirks spread like wildfire.</p>

<div class="narrator">Night falls. Back at the hut, Asahi finishes his chores and practices in the backyard, his wooden sword flashing under the lantern's glow. A log stands upright as his training partner, patiently receiving every strike.</div>

<p>The neighbor kids peek over the fence, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Big bro! Are you training to be a knight or something?"</p>

<p>Asahi chuckles.</p>

<p>"A knight? Me? Don't be ridiculous. I'm going to be… an adventurer!"</p>

<p>The kids gasp like he just declared he would eat the sun for breakfast.</p>

<p>His mother steps out, arms full of firewood. She overhears and frowns.</p>

<p>"Asahi, you're still on about that? Adventurers need strong magic and combat skills. Villagers like us barely have enough magic to light a candle. You'll only end up getting hurt."</p>

<p>One kid pouts.</p>

<p>"Booo! Aunty, big bro didn't even show you his big move! If you saw that, you'd change your mind!"</p>

<p>His mother smiles, amused. Just then, his father strolls out, clearly having listened from inside. His grin is mischievous.</p>

<p>"Oh? Then let's see it. Show us this mighty move of yours, Asahi."</p>

<p>Asahi groans inwardly.</p>

<p>"Damn brats… always stirring trouble."</p>

<p>Still, he readies his stance.</p>

<p>"Fine then. Witness my ultimate technique: The Dragon-Killing Thrust!"</p>

<p>He crouches slightly, gripping the wooden sword tight. His free hand slides along the blade, and the tip faintly glows red.</p>

<p>"So what if my magic is weak? I'll make up for it with raw strength and pour what little magic I have into the exact point of impact. That will give me an edge."</p>

<p>The kids gape in awe. His father, however, wears the expression of a man about to laugh himself to death.</p>

<p>With a shout, Asahi thrusts the blade forward.</p>

<p>"DRAGON-KILLING THRUST!"</p>

<p>The tip slams into the log. A tiny spark crackles, fizzling out almost immediately. The log does not even flinch.</p>

<p>The kids still cheer.</p>

<p>His father? Already doubled over in laughter.</p>

<p>"Hahaha! That's supposed to kill a dragon? Boy, it wouldn't even scratch its butt! Pfft, HAHAHAHA!"</p>

<p>Asahi's face flushes red. His mother covers her mouth, giggling.</p>

<p>"Sh-shut up! I'll get stronger, you'll see!"</p>

<p>But before anyone can tease him further, a thunderous BOOM echoes from the far end of the village. The ground shudders violently, cutting the laughter short.</p>

<div class="narrator">The laughter dies instantly. Dust trickles from the roof beams of the hut. For a moment, the only sound is the cows in the pen mooing nervously.</div>

<p>Asahi's father straightens, his smile gone.</p>

<p>"That… came from the east side."</p>

<p>His mother's face pales.</p>

<p>"The granaries are that way…"</p>

<p>Without another word, the family bolts out of the yard. Neighbors are already spilling into the muddy street, lanterns flickering in their hands. The whole crowd surges toward the rising smoke, hearts pounding with the same dread.</p>

<p>When they reach the eastern edge, the sight waiting for them tears the breath from their lungs.</p>

<p>A creature towers above the shattered huts, its slimy body glistening under the moonlight. A giant newt, easily the size of three houses stacked atop one another. Its long tail thrashes, splintering fences and crushing anything unlucky enough to be in the way. With each wet, guttural hiss, a foul stench spreads—something like rotting fish mixed with poison.</p>

<p>Villagers lie scattered across the ground. Some twitching weakly, faces green as if their very blood had curdled. Others already still, skin mottled with strange dark patches, as though they had rotted in an instant.</p>

<p>Asahi clutches his wooden sword tighter, though his knees shake.</p>

<p>"What… what is that thing?"</p>

<div class="narrator">Then come the voices. Smooth, cruel, and echoing with pride.</div>

<p>Scarlet-robed men step from the shadows, encircling the monster like priests at a ritual. Their strange marks glow faintly on their backs, pulsing in rhythm with the creature's movements.</p>

<p>One of them lifts his arms high.</p>

<p>"Behold, the new age! This beast will shatter the chains of your pathetic, meaningless lives."</p>

<p>Another sneers at the cowering villagers.</p>

<p>"You till soil and beg for crumbs, while the nobles fatten themselves with your labor. But tonight… we grant you liberation. In blood, in pain, in freedom."</p>

<p>A child cries out for his mother. An old man collapses to his knees. Panic ripples through the crowd.</p>

<p>The giant newt bellows, its throat ballooning grotesquely before spewing a jet of toxic slime that melts through a wagon like hot butter.</p>

<p>The villagers recoil in horror. Some try to drag the poisoned to safety, others simply freeze, too terrified to move.</p>

<p>And Asahi, wooden sword still in hand, feels his heart hammer against his ribs. His so-called "Dragon-Killing Thrust" suddenly feels like a joke.</p>

<p>But his eyes narrow.</p>

<p>"Adventurer or not… I can't just stand here."</p>

<div class="narrator">The air is thick with screams and the crackling of burning wood. Asahi grips his sword, but his father suddenly pulls him back by the shoulder. His face is grim, eyes locked on the monster.</div>

<p>"That's no ordinary beast…" he mutters.</p>

<p>Asahi swallows hard.</p>

<p>"Then… what is it?"</p>

<p>His father's jaw tightens.</p>

<p>"A Marsh Newt. They live far out in the Death Swamps, beyond the northern mountains. It's said their bodies carry a miasma so foul it kills anyone who breathes it in. Skin rots, blood curdles, and within moments the body gives out."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widen.</p>

<p>"The Death Swamps? That's weeks away from here! Why would it be here of all places?"</p>

<p>Before his father can answer, the newt lets out another guttural hiss. A dark, sickly green fog seeps from its pores, spreading across the ground like a living thing. The villagers closest to it clutch their throats, collapsing with agonized wails as their skin blisters and peels. The stench of decay makes even the healthy gag.</p>

<p>Asahi stumbles back, covering his nose with his sleeve. His heart pounds faster with every step the cloud creeps closer.</p>

<p>His father's voice cuts through the panic.</p>

<p>"That's the miasma! Don't breathe it in, Asahi! Even a single lungful is death!"</p>

<p>The villagers scatter, but the fog crawls hungrily in all directions. Some collapse mid-run, choking, their bodies twitching before going still.</p>

<p>Asahi looks toward the circle of scarlet-robed men. The miasma curls around their cloaks, yet none of them cough or falter. They stand tall, sneering, eyes gleaming with malice.</p>

<p>Asahi's mother gasps.</p>

<p>"Why… why aren't they affected?"</p>

<p>One of the robed men hears her, grinning as though he enjoys the question.</p>

<p>"The poison of despair spares those who serve it willingly."</p>

<p>The leader raises his hand, pointing straight at Asahi's family. His voice rings out like a verdict.</p>

<p>"Newt! Devour them."</p>

<p>The monster's bulbous eyes swivel. Its slimy head turns slowly, fixing on Asahi and his parents. The miasma churns thicker around its maw as it lumbers forward, each step shaking the ground like thunder.</p>

<div class="narrator">The night becomes a blur of fire, screams, and laughter that is not human. The miasma spreads like a blanket, smothering the village in death. One by one, the voices fade. Children's cries, mothers' wails, fathers' shouts—all swallowed in silence.</div>

<p>When Asahi finally stops running, he collapses at the edge of the forest. His chest heaves, throat raw, eyes stinging. He turns back. Through the trees, he can still see the glow of burning huts, and the shadow of the monster stomping across what was once his home.</p>

<p>His wooden sword is still in his grip. He stares at it, the tip cracked and splintered from his failed strike. His tears drip onto the wood, mixing with the dirt and ash.</p>

<p>The faces of his parents flash before him. His father's laugh. His mother's warm scolding. The bright smiles of the children who believed in him. All gone. All stolen.</p>

<p>His body shakes. At first, from grief. Then, from something else.</p>

<p>He presses the broken tip of the sword into the ground, using it to push himself upright. His voice is hoarse, but steady.</p>

<p>"If I had been stronger… if I had been more than this weak little boy, maybe they wouldn't have died."</p>

<p>He looks again toward the village, fists trembling.</p>

<p>"I swear, no matter what it takes… I'll become strong enough to destroy monsters like that. Strong enough to wipe out those robed bastards. Strong enough that no one ever dies because of me again."</p>

<div class="narrator">The words hang in the night, swallowed by the distant roar of the Marsh Newt.</div>

<p>And in the silence that follows, Asahi takes his first step—not as a farmer's son, not as a boy with weak magic, but as someone who has nothing left to lose.</p>
