<p>Damn… she got me.</p>

<p>Asahi leaned back in his chair, trying to look unfazed while his mind spun. Well… it can’t be that bad, right? What’s the worst a rumor could do?</p>

<p>He cleared his throat. “Fine. But how did you even know? There was no one in the room.”</p>

<p>The redhead propped her chin on her hand, smirk never leaving her face. “Rumors travel fast around here. Faster than magic itself sometimes.”</p>

<p>Asahi narrowed his eyes. “Rumors, huh? And what exactly are they saying?”</p>

<p>Her smirk widened. “That a commoner boy walked straight into the duel room, and instead of being crushed in seconds, he made the Headmaster actually take him seriously. That you fought with fire so sharp it cut through her spells like paper. And that in the end, she personally declared you a special student.”</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, stunned. They’re saying all that? About me?</p>

<p>She leaned closer, voice dropping conspiratorially. “Some say the Headmaster has been waiting years for someone like you. Others whisper you’re her secret apprentice. And of course…” She chuckled. “…there are those betting you’ll wash out in a week.”</p>

<p>Asahi rubbed his temples. Great. Either a prodigy or a joke. No in-between.</p>

<p>Asahi let out a small laugh and leaned back, finally relaxing a little.</p>

<p>“So which side are you on then? Do you think I’m a prodigy or a joke?”</p>

<p>The redhead shrugged casually, twirling her empty goblet between her fingers.</p>

<p>“Neither. I’m neutral.”</p>

<p>Asahi raised a brow. “Neutral, huh?”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” she said with a faint smirk. “I don’t really care either way. This place is just a stepping stone for me. Whether you crash and burn or rise to the top doesn’t change where I’m headed.”</p>

<p>Asahi studied her for a moment, surprised at her bluntness. She really doesn’t care… bold way to say it out loud.</p>

<p>But instead of feeling dismissed, he found himself grinning wider. “Well, at least you’re honest.”</p>

<p>The redhead blinked at his grin, then looked away quickly, a faint blush coloring her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Well… yeah, I guess.”</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head, amused at the sudden shift in her tone. He let her recover before asking, “So… are you a commoner or a noble?”</p>

<p>Her smirk faded. For the first time, her gaze dropped to the table, and her voice lowered.</p>

<p>“It’s… complicated.”</p>

<p>She didn’t elaborate, and Asahi could sense the weight behind her words. He thought about pressing her, but stopped himself. No point digging where someone doesn’t want you to.</p>

<p>Instead, he leaned forward and changed the subject. “Alright then, complicated girl. How about explaining this place to me? I’ve been here less than a day, and I already feel like I’m wandering blind.”</p>

<p>She exhaled slowly, her expression softening as she looked back up at him. “Fine. I’ll give you the crash course. But pay attention, or you’ll end up embarrassing yourself.”</p>

<p>The redhead folded her arms, her eyes narrowing as if she were deciding how much to actually tell him. Finally, she leaned forward.</p>

<p>“Alright, listen carefully. This academy isn’t just a school. It’s a training ground for the elite. Nobles send their children here to polish their power and reputation. Commoners… well, very few make it in. Most of the time, if a commoner is here, it’s because they’re sponsored by a noble or they’ve shown something extraordinary.”</p>

<p>Asahi nodded slowly. Guess that makes me the “extraordinary” one… though it doesn’t feel that way.</p>

<p>She continued, tapping the table lightly.</p>

<p>“Classes are divided by rank. At the bottom, you have the general classes—basic magic theory, combat drills, all the boring stuff. Then you climb into specialized classes where only the talented are admitted: elemental refinement, advanced martial techniques, and spell augmentation. At the very top are the elite courses. Those are invitation-only, meant for the best of the best.”</p>

<p>Her expression darkened a little as she went on.</p>

<p>“The school also runs on a hierarchy outside of classes. Nobles use their family crests like badges of power. They form circles, factions… little kingdoms within the academy walls. If you’re in a powerful circle, you eat well, you get resources, you get teachers who actually care. If you’re not… you’re invisible.”</p>

<p>She leaned back, her smirk returning faintly.</p>

<p>“That’s why rumors about you spread so fast. A commoner dueling the Headmaster and walking out as a special student? That shakes things up. Nobles love gossip, and commoners cling to hope. Either way, everyone’s watching you now.”</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, processing it all. So this place is less of a school… and more of a battlefield wearing a uniform.</p>

<p>Asahi rubbed the back of his neck, frowning.</p>

<p>“Well… that’s a problem. I have no idea what classes I’m even supposed to attend or when. Am I just supposed to wander around until I stumble into one?”</p>

<p>The redhead chuckled softly. “Relax. Your list of classes will probably be waiting in your room by the time you get back. The academy’s magic keeps things… organized.”</p>

<p>That made him blink. “Wait. Hold on. How do you know I’ll be teaching? Did someone tell you that?”</p>

<p>She sighed, giving him a tired look like she was explaining something obvious to a child.</p>

<p>“That’s what a special student is. You learn like everyone else, sure, but you also teach something you’re really good at. That’s the whole point.”</p>

<p>Asahi slumped back in his chair, staring blankly at her. So the Headmaster wasn’t joking… I really have to teach?</p>

<p>Asahi slumped back, groaning. “You’ve got to be kidding me…”</p>

<p>The redhead tilted her head, her lips curling into a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>“What, worried about standing in front of a class? Don’t tell me the boy who fought the Headmaster is scared of a few students staring at him.”</p>

<p>Asahi shot her a flat look. “That’s different. Fighting is easy. Teaching… I don’t even know what I’m supposed to say.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward, smirk widening. “Then what are you good at? Swinging that sword around? Making fire look fancy? Brooding dramatically in corners?”</p>

<p>Asahi nearly choked. “Brooding—? I don’t brood!”</p>

<p>She chuckled, clearly enjoying herself. “Relax, special student. If the Headmaster thinks you’ve got something worth teaching, then you do. Whether you realize it or not.”</p>

<p>She’s enjoying this way too much, Asahi thought, trying not to let his face turn red.</p>

<p>Asahi let out a breath, rubbing the back of his neck. “The only thing I can honestly say I’m good at… is refining the efficiency of my strikes.”</p>

<p>Her brow arched. “Efficiency? What’s that supposed to mean? Don’t be vague, you’ve got me curious now.”</p>

<p>Asahi’s eyes sharpened slightly, a rare flicker of pride slipping through his usual calm. “I’ve trained myself to the point where every single strike I throw… lands at a hundred percent efficiency.”</p>

<p>Silence. She blinked at him, once, twice, then just stared. The seconds dragged on as her expression went blank, almost as if her brain had frozen mid-thought.</p>

<p>Then, finally, she shot upright with a sharp gasp. “ARE YOU INSANE? Do you even realize how absurd that sounds?! A hundred percent efficiency? That’s not just ridiculous—that’s impossible! Even masters waste strength, even prodigies misstep! No one—no one—can hit at perfect efficiency every time!”</p>

<p>Her voice echoed through the training hall, hands thrown into the air like she was about to tear her hair out.</p>

<p>Asahi only tilted his head slightly, a calm smile tugging at the corner of his lips. “Yet… here I am.”</p>

<p>She slammed a hand on the table, pointing at him with wide eyes, her composure cracking for the first time. “You… you absolute monster. Do you have any idea what kind of madness you’ve just admitted to me?!”</p>

<p>He chuckled, shaking his head. “By the way, I’m Asahi. Just Asahi.”</p>

<p>She blinked, then said, “I’m Akari. Just Akari.”</p>

<p>So she’s a commoner… Asahi thought, tilting his head. Then why did she say it was complicated?</p>

<p>Asahi leaned back, trying to appear calm, but Akari was still staring at him, her wide eyes betraying her shock. She rubbed her temples and muttered under her breath, almost to herself.</p>

<p>“There’s… there’s been no case in history where something like that was even remotely possible…”</p>

<p>Asahi’s mind drifted back to his master’s words, the memory flickering like a candle in the dark. “Maybe it’s possible,” his master had said, watching him train with a critical eye. “You have so little magic… maybe that’s exactly why you can achieve something others cannot. Every strike has to count, because you can’t rely on sheer magic power.”</p>

<p>He nodded slightly to himself, recalling the long hours he spent honing each motion to perfection. Well… I barely have any magic. That’s probably why it was so easy.</p>

<p>Akari’s gaze remained fixed on him, disbelief etched into every line of her face. She leaned back in her chair, still trying to process what she had just learned.</p>

<p>This kid… actually did it. Every strike, one hundred percent efficient. There really is no one like him.</p>

<p>Asahi shrugged slightly, a faint smirk on his lips. “Well… I barely have any magic. Maybe that’s why it was so easy.”</p>

<p>Akari blinked, her mouth opening and closing as if she were trying to form words but couldn’t. Finally, she managed a sharp laugh, half incredulous, half frustrated.</p>

<p>“No… that can’t be… you’re telling me it’s because you have almost no magic that you perfected every strike? That’s… that’s insane!”</p>

<p>Asahi leaned back, crossing his arms casually. “Makes sense, doesn’t it? If I had more magic, I could rely on power and force. Since I don’t, I had to make each movement count perfectly.”</p>

<p>Akari shook her head, her red hair swaying with the motion, still trying to digest it all. “I… I can’t even begin to imagine how you did that. That’s never been done in history. Never.”</p>

<p>Asahi only shrugged again, letting her disbelief linger. Let her freak out a bit longer. It’s deserved after all that shock she gave me.</p>

<p>The bell rang sharply through the hall, signaling the end of supper. Asahi glanced at Akari and offered a small nod.</p>

<p>“Thanks for… showing me the ropes for now. I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>She smirked faintly, a hint of blush still on her cheeks. “Yeah, don’t get lost on your way back, special student.”</p>

<p>Asahi chuckled and made his way out of the dining hall, weaving past students now chatting and moving about. His uniform was neat, his sword safely stowed, and for the first time that day, he felt almost… normal.</p>

<p>When he reached his dormitory and opened the door, a faint glow caught his eye. Floating gently in the middle of the room was a single sheet of paper, illuminated as if by its own magic.</p>

<p>Leaning casually against the far wall, arms crossed, was the Headmaster. Her sharp eyes glinted with amusement and authority.</p>

<p>“I see you made it back in one piece,” she said, voice calm but carrying an unmistakable edge.</p>
