<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 19 – SUPPER WITH A REDHEAD</div>

<p>Asahi’s steps echoed through the quiet hallway, his mind still spinning from what had just happened. The duel had ended, but her words lingered. His thoughts drifted back to that moment in the room.</p>

<p>“I… I can’t teach. I’m still just a beginner.”</p>

<p>Beginner? This boy has no idea… The fourth layer is not a place an ordinary person can survive for more than minutes, let alone fight through monsters. And yet here he is. An unbelievable genius, trapped inside a body with a pitifully small magic reserve. If only he knew.</p>

<p>The Headmaster’s expression hadn’t betrayed much, but her eyes had measured him carefully.</p>

<p>“It won’t be a full class. Just a few chosen students. All you’ll have to do is show them how to improve efficiency with their magic.”</p>

<p>“Still… I don’t think I’m ready for something like that. I mean, what if—”</p>

<p>Her gaze sharpened.</p>

<p>“Damn brat. Just accept it. This is the only way you’ll earn money.”</p>

<p>Asahi froze, then stiffened like a soldier before his commander.</p>

<p>“Yes ma’am!”</p>

<p>The memory ended there, leaving him with a sigh as he rubbed the back of his neck while walking down the corridor. Maybe teaching wasn’t the worst thing in the world. Maybe.</p>

<p>Asahi’s steps echoed through the quiet hallway, but this time, he wasn’t alone in the silence. Eyes followed him. Whispers trailed after his back.</p>

<p>“Who let a commoner in here?”</p>

<p>“Did he sneak in somehow?”</p>

<p>“Look at his clothes. He doesn’t belong.”</p>

<p>The murmurs cut sharper than blades, and Asahi quickly realized how out of place he looked. He lowered his head, pulling his shoulders tight, and picked up his pace.</p>

<p>By the time he reached the assigned dormitory, his ears were burning. He pushed the door open in a rush and finally breathed. His mind slipped back to the duel room, where the Headmaster had spoken so matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>“Your dormitory has already been prepared. The uniform as well. All handled with my magic. Registration will be taken care of too. You don’t need to lift a finger.”</p>

<p>He had almost laughed at how casually she’d said it, like reshaping his life was no different than flicking dust from her sleeve. Now, standing in the doorway of his new quarters, he could only shake his head.</p>

<p>Asahi finally reached his dormitory and pushed the door open. The room that greeted him looked nothing like anything he’d ever called home. A wardrobe stood neatly against the wall, holding two perfectly folded sets of uniforms. A sturdy desk with a chair sat in the corner, polished to a shine, and a bed big enough for him to stretch out without his feet hanging off waited invitingly. Through the window, the city sprawled out in glittering lights, the kind of view he’d only ever imagined the nobility enjoyed.</p>

<p>He stepped inside, running his hand over the desk as if to confirm it was real. Then he collapsed onto the bed, the softness swallowing him whole.</p>

<p>Today… what even was today?</p>

<p>The duel. The Headmaster’s strange test. The revelation that he was now a “special student.” And above all, the fading image of his master’s final moments. That weight pressed down on him harder than the whispers in the hall or even the fight itself.</p>

<p>A loud rumble broke through his thoughts.</p>

<p>Growl.</p>

<p>His stomach snarled like a wild beast, and Asahi groaned, covering his face with both hands.</p>

<p>“Great. I fight wyverns, survive illusions, and impress a headmaster… but my biggest enemy is still hunger.”</p>

<p>Asahi rolled over on the bed and noticed a thick book sitting neatly on the desk. He dragged himself up with a sigh and picked it up.</p>

<p>“Rules and Regulations of the Academy…” he read aloud slowly.</p>

<p>Of course. Can’t even survive one day without rules smacking me in the face.</p>

<p>He flipped through the pages half-heartedly, skimming lines.</p>

<p>“All students must attend scheduled lectures and training sessions…”</p>

<p>“Fighting between students is strictly forbidden outside the designated dueling grounds…”</p>

<p>He chuckled. “Too late for that one.”</p>

<p>Turning another page, he read with exaggerated effort.</p>

<p>“Students must wear their academy uniforms when attending classes, meals, or assemblies.”</p>

<p>So I can’t just wander around in my old clothes. Figures.</p>

<p>His eyes stopped at a section marked in bold.</p>

<p>“Supper will be served when the bell rings in the evening for all dormitory students.”</p>

<p>His stomach gave another ferocious growl in response, as if cheering.</p>

<p>“Finally… something good.”</p>

<p>And right then, the distant toll of a bell echoed through the halls.</p>

<p>Asahi jumped up, flipping back quickly to check the instructions.</p>

<p>“All dormitory students must gather on the third floor dining hall immediately after the evening bell.”</p>

<p>He muttered, “Third floor, got it.”</p>

<p>With hurried movements, he stripped out of his worn clothes and slipped into the crisp academy uniform. It felt strange, stiff, but surprisingly comfortable. He hesitated when his eyes fell on the sword.</p>

<p>…Better keep this here for now. Don’t want to scare anyone at dinner.</p>

<p>He carefully set the weapon inside the wardrobe, closing it gently as though it were a treasure chest. Taking one last glance at his reflection in the window, he straightened the uniform and nodded.</p>

<p>“Alright, time to eat like I belong here.”</p>

<p>Asahi climbed up to the third floor and stepped into the dining hall. The place was alive with chatter, laughter, and the clinking of cutlery. Students in matching uniforms filled the long tables, plates piled high with roasted meats, soups, and bread.</p>

<p>To his surprise, no one paid him much attention now. The uniform did its job—he blended in.</p>

<p>Relieved, he slipped into a corner seat, expecting a server to bring food. Instead, he found nothing but an empty wooden board laid neatly in front of him. He stared at it, then at the others already devouring their meals. Platters steamed, goblets gleamed, but there wasn’t a single stall, counter, or server in sight.</p>

<p>What the hell? Did I miss something?</p>

<p>He tapped the board. No response. He waited. Still nothing. His stomach twisted angrily.</p>

<p>That’s when a voice spoke behind him.</p>

<p>“You must be new here, since you don’t even know how to order the food.”</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, turning his head. A girl stood there with her hands on her hips, her long red hair catching the glow of the dining hall lamps. She wore the same academy uniform, though hers looked far more natural on her than his stiff, just-issued one.</p>

<p>Asahi’s eye twitched.</p>

<p>What is it with me and redheads…?</p>

<p>Asahi scratched the back of his head awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Yeah… you got me. I’m new. And I have no clue how to order food here.”</p>

<p>The redheaded girl smirked and slid into the seat across from him.</p>

<p>“Thought so. Watch closely, commoner.” Her tone carried a teasing edge, though her eyes gleamed with amusement rather than cruelty.</p>

<p>She placed her palm flat against the wooden board. A faint glow sparked under her hand as threads of magic seeped into it. With a soft hum, the surface lit up, displaying a menu of food items written in shimmering script—roast chicken, grilled fish, soups, breads, desserts, and drinks.</p>

<p>“You just channel a little mana into the board. It’ll show you the list. Then you touch what you want, and it appears right in front of you.”</p>

<p>To demonstrate, she tapped her finger against “beef stew” and “apple cider.” In an instant, the board shimmered and transformed into a steaming bowl of stew and a frothy mug, the aroma wafting across the table.</p>

<p>Asahi’s eyes widened like a child seeing fireworks for the first time.</p>

<p>This… this is insane. Actual food magic?</p>

<p>He leaned closer, staring at the stew as if it might vanish.</p>

<p>“That’s… that’s amazing.”</p>

<p>The girl grinned, clearly enjoying his reaction.</p>

<p>“Well, go on then. Don’t starve to death on your first day.”</p>

<p>Asahi gulped, pressing his hand against his own board. A flicker of light sparked, and suddenly the glowing menu unfolded before his eyes. His jaw dropped.</p>

<p>“I’ve… never even heard of half of these…” he muttered, scrolling through names that sounded more like spells than meals.</p>

<p>He glanced up. “Uh, any recommendations?”</p>

<p>The redhead leaned back smugly. “Grilled pheasant with herb sauce. Trust me.”</p>

<p>He tapped the options as she said them. In an instant, a plate of golden-brown pheasant appeared, steaming and fragrant, with a goblet of some sparkling drink beside it.</p>

<p>Asahi’s mouth watered immediately. He could feel himself practically drooling. Food this fancy… this is way above my level.</p>

<p>He grabbed the fork in one hand, ready to dig in like a starving wolf—then froze.</p>

<p>Wait. Nobles. Manners. Fork… knife…</p>

<p>He glanced around quickly. Students around him were eating with perfect posture, cutting neatly, sipping daintily. His heart sank.</p>

<p>Damn it. I can’t just tear into it like back home. I’ll stick out like a wild animal.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, he picked up the knife and fork, holding them stiffly. His stomach roared in protest.</p>

<p>The first careful cut slid through the pheasant, and when he finally lifted a piece to his mouth, the flavor exploded across his tongue. His eyes nearly rolled back.</p>

<p>Okay… maybe this fork-and-knife thing isn’t so bad.</p>

<p>Asahi had the time of his life eating. Every bite was a new world of flavor, richer and more delicate than anything he’d ever imagined. The pheasant melted in his mouth, the sauce tingled with herbs he couldn’t name, and the sparkling drink fizzed like liquid joy. For once, his stomach felt not like an enemy, but like a grateful ally.</p>

<p>Across from him, the redhead ate with practiced elegance. She finished her stew and cider, dabbing her lips with a napkin, then leaned forward with a sly glint in her eye.</p>

<p>“Say… are you the new special student who dueled the Headmaster?”</p>

<p>Asahi nearly choked on his drink. He wiped his mouth, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>“What? How do you know that? There was no one in the room.”</p>

<p>She smirked knowingly, her eyes narrowing with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Ah, I knew it was you.”</p>
