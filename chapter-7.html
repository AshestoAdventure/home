<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 7 – A NEW TECHNIQUE</div>

<p>Asahi crouched beside the stream again, his reflection shimmering faintly in the water. He lifted his sword and held it at eye level, staring at the gleaming edge. His brows furrowed as he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>"Just flooding the blade with magic wastes way too much. Even coating the side of the blade or the tip… all of it leaks out before I even hit anything." He tapped the flat of the sword with his finger, shaking his head. "It's useless to let the magic burn during the swing. I need to time it… right before impact. That way nothing's wasted."</p>

<p>His eyes narrowed as the thought took shape. And instead of focusing on how dense the magic is… I need to make it sharp. Like a razor-thin slice that merges with the edge of the weapon itself. A dense ball of magic is flashy, sure, but it doesn't cut as well as a blade infused with a thin, precise line of energy.</p>

<p>He exhaled slowly, gripping the hilt tighter. "If I can do this right, not only will my attacks cost less magic, they'll be deadlier too." His mouth curved into a thin smile. "But… easier said than done."</p>

<p>And so the next week was spent in trial and error.</p>

<p>At first, the sword flared too soon, the magic igniting mid-swing and fizzling out before he even hit his target. Kobolds shrieked with squeaky rage as his blade barely nicked them, and he had to rely on normal steel to finish them off. Goblins, with their nasty little daggers and clubs, cackled as they lunged, forcing him to retreat more than once when his experiments failed.</p>

<p>But little by little, he improved. Each battle became his practice ground. He forced himself to wait until the last fraction of a second, until the blade was about to connect, before letting the magic flicker along its edge. Sparks danced on contact, leaving thin glowing trails that sliced clean through rough leather and rusty iron alike.</p>

<p>Sometimes the magic sputtered. Sometimes it was too strong and drained him faster than expected. And sometimes it worked—beautifully. A single precise strike cleaved through a goblin's weapon and skull in one motion, leaving Asahi wide-eyed with disbelief before muttering, "That… that's it. That's the feel."</p>

<p>The forest rang with the clash of steel and the shrieks of his enemies almost every day. Kobolds fell squealing, goblins died snarling, and Asahi's confidence grew with every encounter. His body toughened, his movements sharpened, and though he was exhausted after each skirmish, his grin never faded.</p>

<p>He wiped his blade one evening, blood dripping into the soil, and whispered almost in relief, "Thank god this area is mostly just goblins and kobolds. Any deeper and I'd be fighting things way too strong for me right now."</p>

<p>It had been over a month in Ironfang Woods. And with every fight, with every swing and every adjustment, Asahi carved his way closer to mastering the art of conserving his magic while maximizing its lethality.</p>

<div class="narrator">The forest Asahi had stumbled into was no ordinary wilderness, but the infamous Ironfang Woods, divided into levels where danger grew with every step inward. The first level was deceptively calm, home to little more than slimes, horned rabbits, and other pests that even children could handle. The second level, where Asahi now fought tooth and nail, was far harsher, crawling with kobolds, goblins, wild boars, and on bad days, hobgoblins or prowling wolf packs. Beyond lay the third level, where ogres, trolls, and giant spiders claimed dominion, creatures strong enough to crush ordinary adventurers with ease. Deeper still was the fourth, where wyverns screeched overhead, chimera prowled with three times the hunger, and serpents long enough to coil around towers slithered in the shadows. And at the very core, in the depths few dared to whisper of, ancient monsters and dragons slumbered, their very existence a reminder of how small men truly were. For now, Asahi remained in the second level, a place the world called weak, but every scar on his body told him how easily even the weak could take a careless life. And honestly, watching him almost get eaten alive by kobolds—yes, kobolds—was enough proof that the forest did not need to send dragons his way just yet. Fate clearly decided that if Asahi was to die, he would at least go out looking ridiculously pathetic first.</div>

<p>The ground shook as the pack of wild boars charged, tusks gleaming and eyes wild with fury. Mud splattered up Asahi's legs as he braced himself, iron sword in hand.</p>

<p>"Damn it, why are there five of them at once!?" he shouted, voice cracking under the pressure.</p>

<p>The boars squealed violently, their high-pitched screeches echoing through the trees. Squeeak! Grrrrk! Krrrhhk!</p>

<p>Okay, focus, Asahi. Don't panic. You've trained for this. Thin edge of magic… not too early, not too late… just before impact.</p>

<p>He swung at the first boar. Clang! Sparks flew as his blade scraped against its tusk, the impact numbing his arm.</p>

<p>"Too early!" he cursed, stumbling back as another boar nearly gored him from the side.</p>

<p>He rolled away clumsily, dirt sticking to his clothes. Tch, sloppy. If I keep wasting magic like that, I'll collapse before I even land a proper hit.</p>

<p>One of the boars lunged, snapping branches as it bulldozed forward. Asahi's eyes widened, heart pounding. He inhaled sharply, tightened his grip, and at the last second—</p>

<p>"Fire Swing!"</p>

<p>The blade lit up with a thin, sharp glow of red. Ssshiiiing! His sword carved through the beast's flank, leaving a crescent trail of searing heat. The boar shrieked as it stumbled sideways, smoke hissing from its wound.</p>

<p>Asahi grinned, panting hard. There we go. That's it. Minimal magic, maximum slice.</p>

<p>But the moment of triumph vanished as another boar rammed into him from behind. "Gwahhh!" he yelped, tumbling face-first into the mud. His sword flew just out of reach, sliding across the dirt.</p>

<p>Ow ow ow ow! My back! I'm gonna snap in half at this rate!</p>

<p>The nearest boar lowered its head, snorting, ready to charge. Asahi scrambled up, snatched his blade, and muttered desperately, Don't screw this up now. Timing, Asahi, TIMING!</p>

<p>The beast came thundering forward.</p>

<p>"Haaaah! FIRE SWING!"</p>

<p>This time his blade flashed just before the hit, cutting diagonally across the boar's head with a sizzling arc. The smell of burnt flesh mixed with smoke. The monster toppled over, twitching once before lying still.</p>

<p>Asahi staggered, chest heaving. "Two down… three to go…" He gave a half-laugh, half-sob. "Who even thought fighting wild boars was a good idea!?"</p>

<p>The remaining three pawed the ground, eyes glowing, breath steaming like tiny demons ready to tear him apart.</p>

<p>Alright, Asahi. You either keep this up… or you're dinner.</p>

<p>The three surviving boars circled him, their tusks glinting in the dim forest light. Their heavy grunts shook the air like a war drum.</p>

<p>"Alright, you pigs… round two!" Asahi shouted, though his voice cracked at the end, betraying his fear.</p>

<p>Okay, timing… sharpness over density. Thin edge, thin edge… don't waste magic.</p>

<p>The first boar lunged. He sidestepped, blade flashing.</p>

<p>"Fire Swing!"</p>

<p>Swoosh! Crackle! The glowing crescent cut across its side, leaving a deep, burning gash. The boar squealed, stumbling but not down.</p>

<p>"What!? You're still kicking!?"</p>

<p>Another boar slammed into him from the front. "Gaaah!" He flew back, rolling across the ground, coughing blood. His chest screamed with pain.</p>

<p>This is bad, really bad. If I mistime even one more, I'm pork chops.</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet, wobbling. The injured boar came again, limping but furious.</p>

<p>Focus. Focus. You can do this.</p>

<p>He steadied his blade, eyes narrowing. At the very last second, his magic sparked like a razor-thin line along the edge.</p>

<p>"FIRE SWING!"</p>

<p>Shhrrrak! The sword cleaved through the beast's neck, sparks spraying as it collapsed in a cloud of dirt and smoke.</p>

<p>"Three down!" he panted, sweat dripping into his eyes.</p>

<p>The last two boars bellowed in rage and charged at once.</p>

<p>"Oh come on, that's cheating!"</p>

<p>He tried to swing, but one clipped his leg, sending him crashing down. Blood trickled from his thigh. He crawled desperately, sword scraping the ground.</p>

<p>"Stay away from me!"</p>

<p>He pulled magic into the blade, trembling. Instead of a swing, he braced it, tip glowing brighter than ever.</p>

<p>"FIRE THRUST!"</p>

<p>Fwooosh! The blade shot forward like a bullet, piercing clean through one boar's skull. The beast twitched once and collapsed, eyes rolling back.</p>

<p>The final boar skidded to a halt, staring at its fallen kin. Its eyes went bloodshot, froth bubbling at its mouth. It pawed the earth, ready to end him.</p>

<p>Asahi's arms shook violently. I can't… my magic's almost gone. If I swing again, I'll collapse. Damn it… I have one chance left.</p>

<p>The boar charged with a furious squeal.</p>

<p>"Haaaah! FIRE THRUST!"</p>

<p>He poured everything he had into the attack. The sword's tip ignited like a burning star, the thrust firing out of his hands.</p>

<p>Fwoooom! The blade glided through the air, straight into the charging boar's open maw, piercing out the back of its skull. Flames burst from the wound as the beast collapsed mid-charge, sliding dead at his feet.</p>

<p>Asahi fell to his knees, gasping. His vision blurred, arms limp.</p>

<p>"I… I did it…" he whispered, trembling. Then louder, with a mix of triumph and disbelief, "I DID IT!"</p>

<p>The corpses of five massive boars surrounded him, smoke and the stench of scorched flesh filling the clearing.</p>

<p>Asahi sat by the stream, legs stretched out, watching fat drip from the roasted pork onto the fire with a sharp sizzle. He tore into the meat with both hands, chewing greedily before leaning back on one elbow.</p>

<p>"Not bad… not bad at all."</p>

<p>Stronger swings, more of them too… but only forty percent efficiency? That's pathetic.</p>

<p>"If I could push that higher, the flames wouldn't just burn—they'd cut."</p>

<p>The less I use, the deadlier I get. What kind of twisted logic is that?</p>

<p>He snorted mid-bite, then laughed, almost choking on the pork.</p>

<p>"So basically, I have to look weak to be strong? What kind of hero story is this?!"</p>

<p>His laughter boomed across the quiet forest—until his body betrayed him. Every muscle suddenly seized, twitching all at once.</p>

<p>"Gaaah—! Oh, come on!"</p>

<p>Ow, ow, ow! Even my toes are cramping! Why is laughing a death sentence right now?!</p>

<p>"Damn it… I don't even have abs yet and they're still trying to kill me!"</p>

<p>He rolled onto his side, trying not to burst out laughing again—because each chuckle sent another wave of pain through him.</p>

<p>Hah… at least… I win this round.</p>
