<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 2 – THE BEGINNING OF A JOURNEY</div>

<p>Asahi trudged through the forest, stomach growling like a feral beast. The only things he had left were the splintered wooden sword in his hand and a single stone he had picked up from the ruined village. His clothes were torn, his shoes caked with mud, and the faint stench of miasma still clung to him.</p>

<p>He stopped by a small stream, eyes narrowing at the rippling water. Hunger gnawed at him like an unrelenting demon.</p>

<p>"Okay… fish. I just need fish. How hard can it be?"</p>

<p>He picked up a stick, sharpened one end with his stone, and fashioned a crude spear.</p>

<p>The first attempt ended with a splash—and nothing. The fish darted away like tiny silver missiles.</p>

<p>"Come on! Don't run, you little jerks!"</p>

<p>Asahi swung again, only to slip on a mossy rock and fall flat on his face with a loud thud. His arms flailed, his pants got soaked, and he groaned in frustration.</p>

<p>"Perfect. Just perfect. Mud, water, and no fish. I'm basically a wet noodle right now."</p>

<p>He tried again. And again. And again. Every strike ended with the fish disappearing like magic. At one point, he jabbed so hard that the stick broke in half, splinters flying into his hand.</p>

<p>"Ow! That's cheating!"</p>

<p>Hours passed. His stomach growled, his back ached, and his patience had evaporated like morning dew. Yet finally, after what felt like a hundred failures, a small, silver fish flopped onto the bank. Asahi's eyes widened in disbelief.</p>

<p>"No way… I actually caught one? Okay, maybe I'm not completely useless."</p>

<p>By sheer luck, he managed to snag one more. Two fish. Not enough to fill his belly, but enough to keep him alive.</p>

<p>He crouched by a tiny fire he had sparked with flint and dried leaves, carefully cooking the fish. The smell made his stomach twist painfully but brought a small sense of victory.</p>

<p>"One day, I'll be able to catch a whole river of fish without all this… chaos. I'll be strong. I'll be an adventurer. I'll—no, I will—change my fate."</p>

<p>He leaned back against a tree, brushing leaves and dirt from his hair.</p>

<p>"Okay, next step: keep moving north. Town. Adventurers' guild. Real gear. Real training. Maybe… maybe even a proper sword instead of this splintery joke."</p>

<p>Then, of course, he tripped over a root, landing on his backside with a WHUMP and flailing wildly in the air.</p>

<p>"ARGH! I hate everything right now! Roots! Trees! Fish! Stupid forest!"</p>

<p>He sat up, rubbing his sore butt and glaring at the offending root.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah… one day I'll be too strong for stupid roots to even exist."</p>

<div class="narrator">The forest he had stumbled into was no ordinary woodland. It was the Ironfang Woods, a place so dangerous that even famed adventurers avoided it unless they absolutely had to. Poisonous plants, predatory beasts, and rogue spirits prowled the shadows, preying on the careless.</div>

<div class="narrator">But Asahi did not know this. All he knew was that he had to keep moving north. The closest town, the nearest adventurers' guild, and a chance at real survival waited in that direction. There was no time to register fears or warnings. He had no choice but to press onward, one clumsy, mud-covered, fish-eating step at a time.</div>

<p>Asahi trudged deeper into the Ironfang Woods, mud clinging to his legs and stomach growling in protest. He had barely eaten the two small fish he caught earlier, and his hands still trembled from the effort.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a rustling came from behind a thick bush. A small figure emerged. Short, scrawny, and almost comically thin, it had greenish skin, pointy ears, and bright, beady eyes that glinted with mischief or maybe just stupidity.</p>

<div class="narrator">The creature was a kobold. Kobolds were among the weakest of monster races, ranking just above goblins in strength but far dumber. Small, cowardly, and cunning only in the simplest of tricks, they mostly scavenged and ambushed in groups. Alone, a kobold was barely a threat to a young adventurer if that adventurer had nerves of steel.</div>

<p>Asahi froze, heart hammering. The kobold hissed and bared its jagged teeth, waving a tiny, rusty dagger. He gripped his wooden sword tighter.</p>

<p>"O-okay. I can do this. I just need to hit it. One, one swing."</p>

<p>The creature let out a squeaky battle cry. Asahi flinched. His knees shook. His sword felt suddenly heavier than ever.</p>

<p>"RUN!"</p>

<p>He bolted before thinking, tripping over roots, slipping in mud, and almost face-planting into a tree. The kobold let out a confused squeak and waddled after him, apparently more annoyed than threatening.</p>

<p>Asahi did not stop.</p>

<p>"No. Not again. Not like last time. I can't fail. I can't let anyone die. Wait, who am I kidding? I'm running. I'm running."</p>

<p>His mind flashed back to the village. Smoke, fire, his parents, the miasma, the screams. Every face, every scream burned into his memory. He had run then. He had fled while everything around him died.</p>

<p>"I can't. I can't run again. Not ever. Never again. If I run now, I'll be the same weak boy, useless."</p>

<p>He skidded to a halt, chest heaving. The kobold stopped too, blinking at him like it had no idea why this giant was panting and shaking in front of it. Asahi raised his wooden sword, trembling, but his eyes were finally steely.</p>

<p>"Okay. No more running. Not today. Not ever."</p>

<p>He squared his stance, fingers gripping the sword tighter than ever.</p>

<p>"I will face you. I will fight. I will survive."</p>

<p>The kobold squeaked again, clearly unimpressed. Asahi charged forward, tripping slightly but managing to swing the wooden sword at the creature. Sparks did not fly. Magic did not flare, but the blade smacked against the kobold's shoulder with a satisfying thwack. The kobold yelped and stumbled backward.</p>

<p>Asahi stepped back, heart still racing, but a small, victorious grin appeared on his face.</p>

<p>"One, one swing. I can do this. I'm not weak. Not anymore."</p>

<p>Asahi gritted his teeth and swung at the kobold again, focusing as best he could. Tiny sparks danced along the tip of his wooden sword, glowing faintly red. He thrust it forward, aiming like a bullet, but the kobold jerked sideways just in time.</p>

<p>"DRAGON KILLING THRUST!" he shouted, lunging with the wooden sword pulled back then shot forward, the faint magic on its tip hissing as it collided with the kobold's shoulder. The kobold squeaked in surprise, flinching, one foot slipping in the mud. Asahi stumbled slightly but managed to keep his balance.</p>

<p>"Okay… okay, that worked. Focus. Keep it tight!"</p>

<p>He backed up and lunged again.</p>

<p>"DRAGON KILLING THRUST!"</p>

<p>The kobold tried to dodge, but the thrust hit its leg. It squealed and hopped on the other foot, kicking up dirt and leaves. Asahi's cheeks were flushed, his arms aching, but he gritted his teeth, feeling a small thrill as the sword tip hummed with magic.</p>

<p>"One more. Just one more… no, keep going!"</p>

<p>He pulled back, then shot forward.</p>

<p>"DRAGON KILLING THRUST!"</p>

<p>The kobold yelped again, its dagger barely able to parry the strike. Sparks sizzled off the impact, and the creature skidded backward into a tree root, tumbling over. Asahi's heart raced, sweat dripping into his eyes.</p>

<p>"DRAGON KILLING THRUST!"</p>

<p>The kobold scrambled, hopping backward, squeaking in panic. Asahi could feel his focus sharpening, tiny bursts of magic channeling into the tip making each thrust sting like a buzzing needle. He could see the fear in the kobold's eyes, matching the determination in his own.</p>

<p>"DRAGON KILLING THRUST!"</p>

<p>Finally, the last thrust landed, the kobold letting out a final squeak before collapsing into the mud. Asahi panted, trembling and covered in sweat and dirt, but a victorious grin spread across his face.</p>

<p>"I did it… I actually did it…"</p>

<p>He tapped the tip of his sword on the ground thoughtfully. Then his mind drifted back to his father's laughter from the village, the words echoing in his head:</p>

<p>"Hahahah! That's supposed to kill a dragon? Like c'mon that won't be enough to scratch its bottom!"</p>

<p>Asahi snorted, a little embarrassed but amused.</p>

<p>"Yeah… Dad's right. Dragon Killing Thrust is way too dramatic for now. I'll rename it… Fire Thrust. That works for now."</p>

<p>He pulled his sword back and thrust it forward experimentally. The faint magic hissed along the tip, moving like a bullet. Tiny sparks danced off the blade, and he couldn't help but smile.</p>

<p>"Fire Thrust. Yep. That's me for now. Soon I'll make it strong enough to actually hurt a dragon… and I'll never forget this first fight."</p>

<div class="narrator">Asahi stood there, chest heaving and mud plastered to every inch of his body, finally victorious over the tiny, squeaky kobold, and it hit him like a bucket of cold water just how weak he really was. The battle had been clumsy, his sword barely humming with magic, and if anything slightly bigger or smarter had shown up he would have been flattened, roasted, or otherwise humiliated in seconds. It was clear that this adventure was going to be far more dangerous than he had imagined, and little did he know, the true monsters were already lurking all around him, hidden in the shadows, watching and waiting for the perfect moment to remind him that being alive was not the same as being safe.</div>
