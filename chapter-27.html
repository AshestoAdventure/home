<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 27 – THE CODE IS CRACKED</div>

<p>Asahi's eyes tracked Akari's movements, his breath steadying with each clash. At first, her attacks felt like pure chaos: fire bursting into water, water vanishing into wind, wind grinding into earth. No pause, no repetition, only a relentless flow that looked impossible to predict.</p>

<p>But the longer he endured, the sharper his mind became. He realized she wasn't just cycling through the elements. If it had been a simple sequence, anyone could have cracked it. What Akari was doing was weaving, layering one element into another with seamless precision, bending the rules of transition so that fire did not just become water, it bled into it, disguised within wind or masked by earth. It was a tapestry of misdirection, meant to overload her opponent's senses.</p>

<p>Still, within that storm of weaving, Asahi began to feel something. Not a pattern in the sense of repetition, but a faint rhythm in the way she layered the shifts. A certain timing, like the hidden beat of a song buried beneath noise. It was fragile, elusive, and maddeningly complex, but it was there.</p>

<p>His lips curved slightly. If he could keep tracking that rhythm, even for a few more exchanges, he might finally step into her flow rather than chase it.</p>

<p>Asahi steadied his stance, his body coiled with tension as Akari surged forward. Her palm ignited in fire, which dissolved into a cutting wave of water before twisting into a gust of wind. He moved before the earth reinforcement could arrive, stepping into the flow just as the rhythm hinted.</p>

<p>His arm shot out, his strike aimed exactly where her guard would falter. For an instant, it felt perfect.</p>

<p>Akari's eyes widened as she caught the motion. He saw through it? Already? She bent her weaving mid-shift, twisting wind into a jagged burst of earth, redirecting the attack. The clash exploded between them, Asahi's counter grazing her shoulder instead of landing true.</p>

<p>Asahi gritted his teeth, pulling back. Almost… I was right. There is a rhythm. But she bent it out of my reach at the last second. I can't just predict her. I need to shape her flow myself.</p>

<p>Akari steadied herself, the faint sting on her shoulder sharpening her focus. Dangerous… He should not have been able to catch even that much. If he keeps pushing, he might start turning my weaving against me.</p>

<p>From the sidelines, Sasaki's eyes narrowed. That was not luck. He is already beginning to slip inside her storm. Akari's weaving confuses most top fighters because they chase her movements. But Asahi… he is starting to hear the music beneath it. If he keeps this up, she will need more than unpredictability to stay ahead.</p>

<p>The air between them thickened again as both fighters reset, their eyes locked, each realizing the stakes had just shifted.</p>

<p>Asahi lunged forward again, eyes locked on Akari's weaving. Fire blurred into water, water hid behind wind, wind split into earth. He cut across her motion, certain he had found the angle this time. His blade of energy grazed her side, forcing her to twist at the last second.</p>

<p>"Tch… again?" Akari muttered under her breath, her smirk returning despite the close call.</p>

<p>Asahi's chest heaved, but his mind was sharper than ever. I'm getting closer. She bends it at the last moment, but the rhythm is real. I just need to follow it deeper.</p>

<p>Another clash erupted, his strike intercepting fire before it could shift, his foot catching her pivot before wind could take hold. He was always a step away from breaking through, always almost there.</p>

<p>Akari narrowed her eyes. Impossible. He should be drowning in the weave. But he keeps forcing me to change my layers faster than I want. He is not guessing—he is… listening.</p>

<p>Sasaki's arms were folded tight, his gaze unwavering. Asahi is cutting into her unpredictability itself. Each near-hit sharpens him more. If this continues, Akari might have to reveal tricks she has never shown in a public duel.</p>

<p>Blow after blow, Asahi pressed, and yet… something gnawed at him. His strikes always ended just short, always slipping through her guard but never locking her down. She's brilliant… no, beyond brilliant. Even if I had all four elements, I could never weave them this perfectly. She's not following a plan, she's creating in the moment, weaving threads from what is happening right now. Her unpredictability isn't a fixed pattern—it's alive.</p>

<p>His fist clenched tighter, his heart thundering as another exchange scattered sparks across the arena floor. That's it. I've been trying to predict something that can't be predicted, because it changes with every breath she takes. She's fighting like flowing water, like a storm that decides its own path as it moves. And I… I've been chasing it.</p>

<p>His lips curved, a rare grin breaking through his focus.</p>

<p>"Akari," he said aloud, voice steady even in the chaos, "if I can't predict you… then maybe I should stop trying."</p>

<p>Her eyes flickered with curiosity for just an instant.</p>

<p>Unpredictability against unpredictability.</p>

<p>Asahi loosened his stance, letting his movements flow erratically, abandoning rigid counters. He began to throw feints, half-committed strikes, strange pauses in his rhythm—chaos mixing with chaos.</p>

<p>For the first time, Akari's brows furrowed as her storm of weaving hesitated, her flow jolted out of its perfect rhythm.</p>

<p>From the sidelines Sasaki's eyes widened. So that's his answer… he's not chasing her anymore. He's making her chase him.</p>

<p>The arena trembled under the force of their chaos. Asahi's erratic strikes met Akari's weaving, a storm of fire, water, wind, and earth colliding with unpredictable bursts of his own. For the first time, the fight felt like two living forces testing each other, neither fully in control.</p>

<p>Asahi's heart pounded as he realized something crucial. Even with my unpredictability, she's still a step ahead. Four elements give her options I can't match. I can't predict her weave the way I thought. She adapts faster than I can respond.</p>

<p>Akari's expression shifted, eyes gleaming. Interesting… he's finally dancing with me instead of chasing. But can he truly match the flow?</p>

<p>Sasaki watched with rapt attention. This is no ordinary duel. They're pushing each other beyond technique—pure instinct and adaptation.</p>

<p>Asahi clenched his fists, fire flickering across his fingertips. He paused for a heartbeat, then a thought struck him. I may not have four elements, but I can weave what I have… the same way she does. Miniature strikes, integrated, layered, rapid—like her, but only with my fire.</p>

<p>He launched a series of tiny fire thrusts, each moving in and out of the next with the precision of a weaving storm. Then he added swings, curves, spins, integrating each strike into the next as if they were multiple elements flowing together. Each burst of fire became a mini-pattern, chaotic to the eye but controlled to him.</p>

<p>Akari blinked, the first real pause in her weaving. He's copying… a weaving of his own, but fire alone?</p>

<p>His strikes began to press her back, not because they were stronger individually, but because the layering created pressure she couldn't anticipate instantly. Small openings began to appear, and Asahi seized them, exploiting the micro-rhythms within his own chaos.</p>

<p>Sasaki's jaw tightened. He's found a way to level the playing field. Even with four elements, her weaving struggles against the precision of a single element mastered like this. This is genius…</p>

<p>Asahi's grin widened as he felt the flow. The tide was shifting, not because he had matched her power, but because he had mirrored her thinking. One small victory at a time, he edged closer to breaking through her legendary unpredictability.</p>

<p>Asahi's strikes flowed seamlessly, each miniature thrust and sweeping arc of fire integrating into the next. His chest heaved with exhilaration as he felt it—he was closing in. For the first time in the duel, he wasn't chasing. He was dictating, even if only slightly, the rhythm of the fight.</p>

<p>Yes… I'm finally pushing her back. Just a little more… one more opening…</p>

<p>Akari's eyes gleamed, but there was something different now—a calm behind the storm. He's good… too good. But he's still playing in my arena. It's time to show him what he can't see coming.</p>

<p>In a sudden motion, she drew forth a hidden technique, one she had never revealed to anyone, not even to the top ten fighters who had faced her. Fire, water, wind, and earth erupted simultaneously around her, but they didn't just clash—they intertwined into a single, living entity, a tornado of raw elemental energy that moved as one. Sparks of fire danced in waterfalls of water, earth pillars twisted into wind currents, all shifting unpredictably but with terrifying cohesion.</p>

<p>Asahi froze for a fraction of a second, his eyes widening. What… is this? She's combining everything at once? How… how is this even possible?</p>

<p>"Did you really think it would be that easy?" Akari's voice was calm but carried a sharp edge, like a razor hidden in silk. "I've been saving this just for you. This is my real weaving, the one even the top five can't touch."</p>

<p>The energy surged toward him. Asahi tried to anticipate it, tried to carve openings, tried to integrate his fire weaving into a counter—but the magnitude, the speed, the living fluidity of her elemental fusion overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>He stumbled backward, fire bursts faltering as he struggled to keep pace. The force of her technique pushed him off balance, and he landed hard on his bum with a grunt.</p>

<p>He exhaled sharply, brushing dust from his shoulder, eyes fixed on her. "I just… I can't get the jump on you. No matter what I do… I can't."</p>

<p>Akari floated above him, the storm around her slowly settling, a faint smile on her lips. "It's not about jumping anyone, Asahi. It's about dancing in the storm… and right now, I lead."</p>

<p>Sasaki's arms crossed tightly, his jaw tense. Incredible. He's pushing her closer than anyone else ever has… and she still has that kind of ace in her sleeve. This fight… it's something else entirely.</p>

<p>Asahi looked up at her, a mix of frustration and awe in his eyes. She's not just unpredictable… she's a genius. And I… I've never faced anything like this.</p>

<p>The sharp clang of the lunch bell echoed across the arena, breaking the tension. Both fighters stepped back, brushing off sweat and dust as they headed toward the exit.</p>

<p>Akari glanced at Asahi, her expression teasing. "You know… you could've just finished it with your usual style. The same way you took down Kenzo."</p>

<p>Asahi shook his head, a faint grin on his face. "If I had… I wouldn't have learned even half of what I did today. Pushing through your weaving, even just a little, taught me more than any easy victory could."</p>

<p>Akari shrugged, pretending nonchalance, though her eyes betrayed a flicker of respect. He's annoying… but he's not bad. Just don't get cocky, Asahi.</p>

<p>Sasaki trailed behind them, thinking furiously. She's fast, clever, unpredictable—but Asahi is beyond her in raw skill. Today just made her look more impressive than she really is. He's testing limits she could never actually break.</p>

<p>The three of them continued down the corridor toward the lunch hall, the echoes of the fight still lingering in their minds. For Asahi, it was just another step in mastering both his own power and the unpredictability of others.</p>
