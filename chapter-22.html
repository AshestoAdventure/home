<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 22 – THE CONTENDER</div>

<p>Asahi gripped his sword and took a breath. Well, I won't use augment mode for now. I'll just rely on my precision strikes. Not like I have any other weapon in the first place.</p>

<p>The commoner don smirked and lunged forward, his blade flashing at an impressive speed. The kind of speed that would overwhelm monsters in the third layer without much effort.</p>

<p>But to Asahi, it was nothing new.</p>

<p>Steel met steel with a clean clang, his block firm and unshaken. Hm? That wasn't even that heavy. Maybe he's not even going all out yet.</p>

<p>The don pressed forward, slashing and thrusting in a relentless sequence. Asahi parried, deflected, and sidestepped, each movement sharp and efficient, as though he had practiced the same strikes ten thousand times until they became second nature. Not once did he need to coat his weapon with magic.</p>

<p>The watching students gasped and whispered.</p>

<p>"Whoa!"</p>

<p>"Did you see that block?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't taken a single step back yet!"</p>

<p>In hidden corners of the room, unseen eyes observed quietly. High-ranking faculty members, keeping their presence concealed.</p>

<p>"He's not half bad," one whispered.</p>

<p>"His form… it's sharper than most seasoned fighters."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sasaki stood off to the side, his knees shaking as though he were the one in the duel. He clutched his clipboard so hard his knuckles turned white. This is insane. I'm going to have a heart attack before class is even over!</p>

<p>The commoner don finally leapt back, giving a crooked smile. "Your physical skills are at least impressive. But don't get cocky. I've only been using ten percent of my power."</p>

<p>The crowd immediately erupted.</p>

<p>"Ohhh, that explains it!"</p>

<p>"No wonder the special student could keep up!"</p>

<p>"He was being toyed with this whole time!"</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head, unfazed. "Figures. Then again…" He adjusted his grip, eyes calm. "I wasn't even using ten percent either."</p>

<p>The room went silent for half a second. Then chaos.</p>

<p>"What did he just say!?"</p>

<p>"Blasphemy!"</p>

<p>"Is he mocking the don!?"</p>

<p>Sasaki nearly dropped his clipboard, stuttering under his breath. "Wh-wh-why would you say that out loud?! You're supposed to stay low profile! I'm going to die of stress before you do!"</p>

<p>The commoner don's grin widened into something wild. His blade rose again, sparks dancing off the edge. "You've got guts, special student. Let's see if you can keep that confidence when I get serious."</p>

<p>The commoner don's smirk deepened. His sword lowered slightly, and then his entire body began to glow with a faint, pulsing light. Lines of energy shimmered across his arms and legs like veins of molten fire.</p>

<p>The crowd immediately stirred.</p>

<p>"He activated his augment mode!"</p>

<p>"No way, he's taking this seriously now!"</p>

<p>"Isn't that level two glow?"</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes narrowed. So he's an augmentor. That explains why his earlier strikes felt lighter. He wasn't showing anything yet.</p>

<p>The don spread his stance, voice carrying across the room. "I'll say this once. Augment Mode, Level Two. Don't die too quickly, special student."</p>

<p>With a burst of speed, he launched forward, the ground beneath his feet cracking faintly. His sword blurred as he came at Asahi with a downward strike meant to crush rather than test.</p>

<p>He's faster… definitely faster. Stronger too.</p>

<p>Steel clashed again, this time sending vibrations through Asahi's arms. He slid back half a step, boots scraping across the training floor. The don didn't let up, slashing from the side, then thrusting with frightening precision.</p>

<p>The spectators leaned forward, gasping and murmuring.</p>

<p>"Look at that speed!"</p>

<p>"Now he'll crush him!"</p>

<p>"Let's see that commoner get flattened!"</p>

<p>Sasaki was practically hiding behind a mannequin, peeking out with one eye, trembling so badly his glasses nearly slipped off his nose. "L-Level Two Augment Mode against someone who hasn't even activated his? This is suicide!"</p>

<p>Asahi steadied himself, parrying another heavy blow. So this is his true strength. But even so… compared to that spider in the fourth layer, his movements are still readable. My eyes can keep up.</p>

<p>The don grinned, pressing closer, his blade glowing faintly with his magic. "Still standing? Good. Now let's see how long you can last."</p>

<p>Asahi drew in a slow breath. His sword arm tightened, his strikes becoming sharper, each movement stripped of excess. I'll show him what efficiency means.</p>

<p>The don's aura flared brighter as he came in hard, his blade cleaving downward with explosive force. Asahi braced, his sword glowing faintly as he embedded a thin layer of magic into the steel. The two weapons clashed, sparks bursting out in all directions.</p>

<p>The spectators gasped again.</p>

<p>"He's still holding out?"</p>

<p>"Impossible… he hasn't even activated augment mode yet!"</p>

<p>Embedding magic into the blade sharpens its edge and strengthens the guard. It's not flashy, but it's enough. Asahi's eyes tracked every motion, his augmented vision slowing the don's movements just enough to anticipate them. Still… he's clever. He's not just relying on brute force.</p>

<p>The don abruptly shifted his weight, twisting his sword at the last instant. Instead of pushing forward, he let the pressure drop, aiming a slash at Asahi's exposed side.</p>

<p>Asahi pivoted just in time, his blade scraping along the attack and deflecting it. He countered with a precise thrust aimed at the don's shoulder. The don parried, smirking. "Not bad. You read that."</p>

<p>The duel turned into a rhythm of steel — feints, parries, quick evasions. At one point, the don feigned a wide swing only to let go of the hilt with one hand, sending a sudden punch toward Asahi's jaw. Asahi tilted his head back, narrowly avoiding it, and brought his sword up in a controlled arc that would have grazed the don's chin had he not leaned away at the last moment.</p>

<p>The crowd grew louder with every exchange.</p>

<p>"This isn't just brute force, they're reading each other!"</p>

<p>"I've never seen the don fight this cautiously before."</p>

<p>"Is the special student actually… pushing him?"</p>

<p>Sasaki had his face buried in his clipboard, peeking through the tiniest crack between pages. "O-O-Oh gods… they're both insane. I should've stayed in the lab…"</p>

<p>Asahi breathed evenly, eyes locked on his opponent. His augment mode gives him strength and speed, but my strikes waste nothing. Every movement counts. If I keep my calm, I can match him blow for blow.</p>

<p>The don grinned, sweat starting to dot his forehead. "I'll admit it, special student. You're making this fun."</p>

<p>Fun, huh? Asahi tightened his grip. Let's see how long I can keep this balance up without pushing further.</p>

<p>The commoner don leapt back after another fierce exchange, his breathing heavier now, his glowing aura still pulsing. He steadied his blade and looked directly at Asahi, eyes burning with irritation—though not disdain.</p>

<p>"You…" he said, voice carrying through the training hall. "You're no pushover. To hold out against my Level Two augment mode without even activating your own… that's no small feat. You're worthy of respect."</p>

<p>The words echoed, leaving the hall momentarily silent.</p>

<p>The commoner students, who had been watching with baited breath, suddenly erupted.</p>

<p>"He admitted it!"</p>

<p>"A commoner acknowledging another commoner… in front of everyone!"</p>

<p>"This Asahi might actually be something else."</p>

<p>A new admiration lit their eyes, many of them glancing at Asahi as though seeing him for the first time.</p>

<p>On the other side, the nobles reacted with mixed expressions. Some scoffed and shook their heads.</p>

<p>"Hmph, what foolishness."</p>

<p>"Lowering himself to praise a special student commoner?"</p>

<p>"Pathetic."</p>

<p>But others, quieter and more discerning, murmured to themselves.</p>

<p>"…Still, to endure Level Two without augmenting…"</p>

<p>"…Perhaps this boy isn't just some handpicked experiment…"</p>

<p>Even the nobility don, who had been watching with folded arms, gave a faint nod of approval in his thoughts. Not bad. He isn't just talk. Perhaps he really does deserve that special student position.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sasaki, who had been quivering behind the mannequins since the beginning, finally let out a shaky exhale of relief. He adjusted his spectacles with trembling fingers. "W-Well… at least the don acknowledges him. Maybe I won't die of a heart attack today after all…"</p>

<p>Asahi stood calmly, sword still in hand. He hadn't said a word during the recognition, but inside, his thoughts stirred. Respect, huh? That's something I never expected to get here so soon…</p>

<p>The commoner don's eyes narrowed, and his grin turned sharper, more predatory. "You've done well so far… but now, it's time. Level Three augment mode."</p>

<p>A collective gasp erupted through the hall.</p>

<p>The spectators froze. Whispers spread like wildfire.</p>

<p>"Level Three?!"</p>

<p>"That's… the last time someone used that, it was chaos!"</p>

<p>"High-ups had to come down and stop the duel!"</p>

<p>"Everyone stay back!"</p>

<p>Even the previously scornful nobles fell silent, their expressions caught between awe and tension.</p>

<p>As the don's body began to shimmer, faint lines of divine light tracing over his skin, his form shifted. His muscles subtly expanded, his sword glowed like a streak of molten gold, and a faint aura of power radiated from him, elegant yet fearsome.</p>

<p>It was exquisite. Every movement, every line of his body seemed almost sculpted by the hand of a god.</p>

<p>The nobility don, standing off to the side, let a small, approving smile curl his lips. Not bad. He actually looks divine at this level. Even I respect this.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened as he watched, his sword at the ready. Damn… that's a lot of wasted magic, he thought. All that power just to look divine and scare the crowd. Still, impressive. Really impressive.</p>

<p>Sasaki, peeking out from behind the sidelines, was nearly trembling out of sheer terror and awe. "O-Oh gods… Level Three… it's beautiful… and terrifying… I might actually die witnessing this…"</p>

<p>The crowd, commoners and nobles alike, instinctively stepped back, forming a larger circle. Even those who had scorned the don before now stared in silence, caught between fear and admiration.</p>

<p>The commoner don raised his blade, the divine glow reflecting off the polished floor. "Prepare yourself, special student. This is what true strength looks like."</p>
