<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 3 – INTO THE BEAST'S LAYER</div>

<p>The forest only grew darker the further Asahi walked. Towering trees with twisted branches clawed at the sky, blotting out the sunlight until the path ahead seemed to melt into shadow. Strange noises echoed through the undergrowth, the kind of sounds that made his skin crawl—clicks, hisses, rustles too heavy to belong to rabbits. Every step felt like trespassing into someone else's territory.</p>

<p>His stomach growled loudly, reminding him that the fish he had barely managed to catch earlier was long gone. The air here tasted different too, thicker, almost sour, as if the forest itself wanted to choke him out. Still, he pressed on, clutching his sword even though his arms ached from the kobold fight.</p>

<p>There was no telling what lay ahead, but every instinct screamed that this was not just a forest. This was a hunting ground. And Asahi was the prey.</p>

<p>Asahi leaned against the rough bark of a tree, chest heaving and arms trembling from the kobold fight. He had won, but only barely, and the truth hit him hard: he was weak. If a single kobold had nearly gotten better of him, then the path to becoming an adventurer was going to be far more dangerous than he imagined.</p>

<p>If I struggled this much against something so small, I won't survive long out here. First, I need to train. Hard.</p>

<p>He picked up his wooden sword and examined the tip, smudged with dirt and a few tiny burn marks from the Fire Thrust.</p>

<p>"Alright… let's see if we can do this properly."</p>

<p>He raised his sword, took a deep breath, and thrust forward. The blade cracked against the tree bark, sending splinters flying. A faint flame flickered at the tip, vanishing almost immediately.</p>

<p>Wait… that was stronger than before.</p>

<p>Excited, he pulled back and thrust again, gritting his teeth. Sparks sizzled along the tip, and a chunk of bark flew off.</p>

<p>"Yes! That's more like it!"</p>

<p>He tried a second swing but tripped over a root and fell flat on his face. Mud smeared across his cheeks and arms.</p>

<p>"ARGH! Stupid root!"</p>

<p>Get up… get up… focus…</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet, took a few steps back, and lunged with his Fire Thrust again. This time the blade connected more solidly, and a small flicker of flame danced along the tip. Bark splattered across his boots.</p>

<p>"Haha! That's it! That's real progress!"</p>

<p>He swung again and again, each thrust landing more precisely, the flame growing slightly with every hit. Occasionally he slipped or missed, shouting in frustration each time.</p>

<p>"Ugh! How am I supposed to control this if my feet won't cooperate?!"</p>

<p>Mud flew, sparks hissed, and the tree gradually became scarred with tiny burn marks. Asahi's arms ached, his breathing grew ragged, and sweat streamed into his eyes. He wiped it away and grinned.</p>

<p>Yes… this is it. I can feel it. I'm getting stronger. Every swing counts.</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, thinking back to his father's laughter in the village.</p>

<p>Father said Dragon Killing Thrust couldn't even scratch a dragon's butt… maybe he was right. For now… Fire Thrust will do.</p>

<p>"Fire Thrust… okay, that's the name for now."</p>

<p>He practiced again, over and over, shouting the name each time he thrust, slipping and stumbling but landing just enough sparks and splintered bark to keep himself motivated. Each strike felt slightly more controlled, slightly more powerful.</p>

<p>"Fire Thrust! Fire Thrust! Fire Thrust!"</p>

<p>I have to get better… I can't let fear decide my life again.</p>

<p>The forest around him was quiet except for the sound of his panting and the thuds of his wooden sword. But in the shadows, unseen eyes watched. Every swing echoed through the trees, every tiny flame flicker a beacon to the dangers lurking just beyond sight.</p>

<div class="narrator">Experience is a harsh teacher, but nothing accelerates growth like real danger. The terror of battle had sharpened his focus, allowing his sword to land with more weight and precision than before. But experience alone is not enough. It must be consolidated through relentless practice. Every slip, every fall, every spark, and every splintered bark was shaping him, building the foundation of skill that he would need to survive. Yet the forest was far from idle. Shadows crept between the trees, patient and waiting, and the true dangers of Ironfang Woods were far from finished testing him.</div>

<p>Asahi paused for a moment, wiping sweat from his eyes and catching his breath. The Fire Thrust practice had left him exhausted but exhilarated. Then, a faint rustling echoed from the underbrush.</p>

<p>What now…?</p>

<p>Before he could even react, a massive shape dropped from the trees. Its body was as thick as a small cart, legs bending at sharp angles, and fangs dripping with venom. Eight black eyes glinted as it hissed, and silk threads whipped around the clearing.</p>

<p>"A spider…?!"</p>

<p>No… this is huge… half the size of the newt back in my village… I'm not ready for this!</p>

<p>He raised his sword instinctively and thrust forward, the tip glowing faintly red.</p>

<p>"Fire Thrust!"</p>

<p>The blade slammed against one of the spider's legs. Sparks flew, bark and mud scattering, but the creature barely flinched. Its chitinous limb was thick, strong, and unyielding. The impact left almost no mark.</p>

<p>It's… it's so strong… my Fire Thrust isn't even scratching it!</p>

<p>The spider's eight eyes turned toward him, each one tracking his movements with unnerving precision. It hissed and skittered closer, silk threads clinging to the trunks around it, cutting off escape routes.</p>

<p>I need to run… now… or I'm done for!</p>

<p>Asahi dropped the sword in a desperate grip and sprinted through the underbrush, branches snapping across his back. His lungs burned, his legs screamed, and every instinct screamed that this creature would not let him escape. The forest seemed to close in around him as he ran, the spider moving with terrifying speed behind him, locking its gaze on him like a predator that had already chosen its prey.</p>

<div class="narrator">A single strike had shown him the gap between experience and true strength. Fire Thrust was impressive against a kobold or a tree, but against a monster born of the wild, it was barely a scratch. The forest had many hunters, and Asahi was learning the hardest lesson of all. Survival was not about courage alone. It was about speed, wit, and knowing when to run. At that moment, there was no doubt. The giant spider had locked onto him, and running was the only option.</div>

<p>Asahi darted between trees, leaping over roots and ducking under low-hanging branches. Every step felt heavier, his lungs screaming for air.</p>

<p>It's gaining on me… it's gaining on me…</p>

<p>Branches whipped against his face, tearing small cuts that stung and dripped with blood. He stumbled over a hidden root, scraping his knees and elbows raw.</p>

<p>"No… please… don't… don't eat me!"</p>

<p>The spider's legs lashed out, smashing a fallen log where he had just been. Splinters flew, and Asahi tumbled forward, his shoulder hitting the ground hard. Pain shot up his arm.</p>

<p>I can't… I can't keep this up… it's too fast… too strong… and I don't even have my sword!</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet, heart hammering, and tried to fend it off with his fists, but the spider barely noticed. Its legs moved with terrifying precision, knocking him to the ground again.</p>

<p>"Please… just leave me alone…!"</p>

<p>The spider advanced relentlessly, eight black eyes locked on him without mercy. Silk threads whipped past him, brushing against his back and tearing his shirt. Blood ran freely from a deep gash across his cheek and another on his thigh.</p>

<p>I'm going to die… I can't survive this…</p>

<p>Another swipe from the spider's leg sent him sprawling. Pain radiated through his side, and he coughed, tasting blood in his mouth. The creature didn't hesitate, and every movement reminded him how utterly outmatched he was.</p>

<p>"I… I beg you… please… just don't… don't kill me…"</p>

<p>The spider closed the distance relentlessly, its fangs glinting, legs snapping, and silk threads cutting paths across the forest floor. Asahi's vision blurred from pain and blood, and he could feel his strength fading with every desperate step.</p>

<hr>

<p>Asahi stumbled through the underbrush, bleeding and exhausted, when a sudden hissing echoed through the trees.</p>

<p>What now…?</p>

<p>From the shadows, a massive snake emerged. Its scales shimmered like polished obsidian, eyes cold and calculating. The snake's body was as thick as a tree trunk, coiling and uncoiling with terrifying speed.</p>

<p>No… that thing… it's huge…</p>

<p>The giant spider skidded to a stop in front of him, legs raised defensively. Its eight eyes glared at the new threat, and it let out a hiss of its own.</p>

<p>"What… is happening?!"</p>

<p>The two monsters collided. The spider lashed out with every leg, striking the snake again and again, but the snake's scales were impervious. Within moments, the spider was pinned under the coiling serpent. Its struggles grew weaker as the snake tightened its grip.</p>

<p>It's… it's not even a fight…</p>

<p>Asahi could only watch, frozen in place, as the snake's massive jaws opened. The spider thrashed one last time before the snake snapped it up in a single, terrifying motion. Sparks flew from the forest floor as the snake swallowed the spider whole.</p>

<p>"No… no… this can't be real…"</p>

<p>Blood, silk, and venomous liquid dripped from the snake's fangs. Asahi's knees went weak and his jaw dropped. His hands shook uncontrollably.</p>

<p>That spider… the one that was hunting me… it's gone… just gone… and I'm still here…</p>

<p>The forest fell silent for a moment, only the hiss of the giant snake breaking the stillness. Asahi's heart pounded in his chest as he realized just how small and powerless he truly was in this deadly place.</p>

<p>Asahi's legs trembled, and he pressed himself against a tree, trying to stay as still as possible. Blood dripped from his wounds and smeared across his arms.</p>

<p>Please… just don't notice me…</p>

<p>The snake's massive head lifted, scales glinting in the dappled sunlight. Its eyes locked onto him with a terrifying, unblinking focus.</p>

<p>No… no, no, no…</p>

<p>It began to slither forward, each movement sending the ground trembling beneath its weight. Branches snapped under its massive coils, and the forest seemed to shrink around Asahi, closing him in.</p>

<p>"Stay… stay still… please…"</p>

<p>The snake's forked tongue flicked out, tasting the air, sensing his every heartbeat. Asahi's mind raced, trying to think of any escape, any plan, but fear had frozen him in place.</p>

<p>The creature advanced relentlessly, narrowing the distance between them with terrifying speed. Every instinct screamed at him to run, but his body refused to obey.</p>

<p>I'm not ready… I'm not ready… I can't fight this…</p>

<p>The tip of the snake's massive head brushed a fallen branch near him, snapping it with a crack. Asahi's eyes widened, and his heart pounded like a drum in his chest.</p>

<div class="narrator">Ironfang Woods does not forgive hesitation, and it does not wait. The snake had found its prey, and there was nowhere to hide. Asahi's fate hung by a thread, the forest holding its breath. Whatever happened next would decide if he survived or became another shadow in the endless hunger of the wild.</div>

<p>The snake inched closer. Its eyes never leaving him.</p>
