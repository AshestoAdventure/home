<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 21 – RUDE STUDENTS</div>

<p>Asahi paced a little between the rows of mannequins, hands in his pockets. The silence of the room pressed in, and for the first time he realized just how empty his head was when it came to teaching. He glanced back at Sasaki, who was calmly jotting something down in his ever-present notebook.</p>

<p>“…Hey,” Asahi muttered, scratching his cheek. “If I’m supposed to, you know, demonstrate something … how the hell am I supposed to do that? I mean, I can’t just lecture them for an hour straight, right?”</p>

<p>Sasaki looked up as if the answer were obvious. “You may use the mannequins for demonstrations. They are durable and reset after every session. Alternatively, the academy provides temporary golems, conjured through standardized magic circles.”</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. “Golems? Like—actual moving targets?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.” Sasaki reached into his bag and pulled out several folded sheets of paper. Each was marked with intricate circular patterns, symbols carefully inscribed along the edges. He handed them over as though it were the most casual thing in the world. “Here. These are school-issued summoning circles. Place one on the floor, channel a small amount of energy into it, and the construct will form.”</p>

<p>Asahi took the papers gingerly, staring down at the dizzying designs. The symbols looked like a nightmare scribbled by some geometry-obsessed lunatic. His stomach sank. Great. Magic circles. The one thing I have no clue about. If I fumble this in front of Sasaki, he'll figure out I'm a total fraud.</p>

<p>He forced a grin and nodded, slipping the papers under his arm. “Yeah… yeah, seems simple enough.”</p>

<p>But before he could stew in his panic, Sasaki continued, speaking in his usual matter-of-fact tone. “Of course, you may not be familiar with the finer details. The process is straightforward. You simply place the circle flat, touch its center, and imagine releasing your energy into it. The spell matrix does the rest. It is deliberately foolproof—designed for even first-years to operate.”</p>

<p>Asahi’s shoulders sagged in relief. Thank god he explains everything without me even asking. If I play it cool, he'll just keep filling in the gaps on his own.</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh and folded the papers carefully. “Right. Foolproof. Got it.”</p>

<p>Sasaki arched a brow. “Indeed. Though if you fail, that would be quite impressive in its own way.”</p>

<p>“…Thanks for the vote of confidence.”</p>

<p>The minutes slipped away faster than Asahi expected. Their back-and-forth with Sasaki about lesson plans and demonstrations carried them all the way to the scheduled time, and before he knew it, the classroom doors creaked open and students began pouring in.</p>

<p>One after another, they filled the seats and the standing space near the training floor. Sasaki had mentioned earlier that the class roster counted eighty-seven names. Yet when he finished tallying the crowd, his eyes widened behind his glasses.</p>

<p>“Sir Asahi,” Sasaki whispered, adjusting his spectacles nervously. “We have… one hundred and twelve in attendance today.”</p>

<p>Asahi leaned back slightly. “Huh. That’s… more than a few extra.”</p>

<p>“Word must have spread. It seems many were curious to witness your first session.”</p>

<p>A low murmur rippled through the crowd. Most of the faces staring back at Asahi weren’t exactly friendly—smirks twisted with superiority, doubt, and more than a little disdain.</p>

<p>He crossed his arms. “…Charming bunch.”</p>

<p>“Statistics, sir?” Sasaki asked politely, already ready with his notes.</p>

<p>“Hit me.”</p>

<p>“Roughly half nobles, half commoners,” Sasaki replied in his usual calm tone. But before he could elaborate, a loud commotion erupted from the middle rows. Students were shuffling aside, murmuring as two figures locked eyes and stepped toward each other, the tension between them palpable.</p>

<p>Asahi frowned. “…And what’s that about?”</p>

<p>Sasaki didn’t even glance up from his notebook. “Ah. Those are the dons. One represents the nobility faction, the other the commoners. They’ve been rivals since the very beginning. It is said both rank among the top five students of this generation.”</p>

<p>Asahi’s eyes lit up like a kid discovering candy. He leaned forward eagerly. “Oh, so we’ve got ourselves a fight between the dons? Nice, I was just wondering how to spice things up!”</p>

<p>Sasaki’s pen stopped mid-scribble. He looked at Asahi, utterly deadpan. “You… are the teacher, sir.”</p>

<p>“…Right.”</p>

<p>“You must intervene. Quickly. If a duel breaks out, the session will collapse before it even begins. And I would remind you…” Sasaki lowered his voice, glancing subtly at the walls and ceiling. “…the academy’s high councilors are almost certainly observing in secret.”</p>

<p>Asahi straightened, suddenly feeling the weight of invisible eyes pressing down from every direction. He sighed under his breath. Great. My first day, and I’ve got to play referee between two hot-headed prodigies.</p>

<p>Still, a spark of excitement refused to leave his grin. “Fine, fine. Guess it’s showtime.”</p>

<p>Asahi let out a small sigh and started striding toward the commotion, every step echoing across the training hall. The circle of students parted slightly as he approached, though most stayed just to see what kind of disaster would unfold.</p>

<p>The two dons were standing chest to chest, sparks practically crackling between them.</p>

<p>Asahi cleared his throat and raised his voice. “Alright, what exactly do you two think you’re doing?”</p>

<p>The whole room seemed to freeze.</p>

<p>Inside his head, Asahi was screaming. Oh, great. What am I doing? This is stupid. I should be in bed right now. Yep, this is how I die. First day on the job, teacher flattened between two meatheads.</p>

<p>The dons turned their heads slowly toward him. Both pairs of eyes locked on Asahi like predators spotting prey.</p>

<p>“HUUUUH?!” they shouted in unison, the sound rattling the walls.</p>

<p>Asahi didn’t flinch, at least not on the outside. His face stayed composed, calm as if he had expected this reaction all along.</p>

<p>Behind him, however, Sasaki, still a few meters back, jumped so hard he nearly dropped his notebook. His glasses slipped down the bridge of his nose, and he scrambled to push them back up, whispering frantically, “D-Don’t scare me like that!”</p>

<p>Asahi, fighting a smirk, thought to himself, Well, at least I wasn’t the only one spooked. Good job, Sasaki, you took the fall for me.</p>

<p>Asahi planted his feet firmly on the ground and raised his voice just enough for the crowd to hear. “You two are here for my class, are you not? If you want to fight, then take it outside. Otherwise, you’re wasting everyone’s time.”</p>

<p>The students gasped like he’d just insulted the royal family. The two dons turned toward him with narrowed eyes.</p>

<p>One of them scoffed. “Tch. He’s just a special student. Where does he get off talking like that to his seniors?”</p>

<p>The other one smirked. “Bold words for someone who probably won’t even last a week.”</p>

<p>Behind Asahi, Sasaki was trembling so hard his knees knocked together, his notebook clutched to his chest like it was a holy relic. He whispered, “We’re dead, we’re so dead…”</p>

<p>Ok, in times like this, it’s important to make a good first impression, Asahi told himself, forcing his face to stay stone-cold serious while his stomach churned. They need to see I have a backbone… not a chicken bone.</p>

<p>He let out a calm breath and spoke loud enough for everyone to hear. “If you two want to go at each other so badly, then why don’t one of you spar with me instead? I’ll use it as a demonstration for the rest of the class.”</p>

<p>The silence that followed was thick enough to cut with a sword.</p>

<p>Inside, Asahi was screaming. WHAT am I doing?! Did I just challenge the top five of this entire generation?! This is suicide! Yep, goodbye cruel world. At least my uniform will still be intact when they bury me.</p>

<p>But then he reminded himself, just barely keeping his composure, Wait… I did hold my own in the fourth layer. I’m not completely hopeless. I might not win, but at least I won’t embarrass myself… hopefully.</p>

<p>The students murmured in excitement, the tension in the room doubling. Sasaki, on the verge of fainting, muttered, “H-he’s lost his mind…”</p>

<p>The commoner don tilted his head with a grin. “Oh? You’ve got some backbone at least. I’ll give you that.”</p>

<p>The nobility don scoffed, his eyes sharp as daggers. “He’s asking for death.”</p>

<p>For a moment, Asahi expected them to start swinging at each other again. Instead, the two dons suddenly turned to face each other, fists raised.</p>

<p>“Rock, paper, scissors.”</p>

<p>The whole room froze.</p>

<p>They threw their hands forward. The commoner don’s scissors cut right through the nobility don’s paper.</p>

<p>The commoner students all stared with blank faces, as if they couldn’t quite believe their leader had settled the matter with a children’s game. The nobles, meanwhile, looked on with thinly veiled disgust, glaring especially at the commoner don as though he had just dragged their prestige through the mud.</p>

<p>The nobility don clicked his tongue. “Tch. Go ahead. Waste your time.”</p>

<p>The commoner don, however, practically bounced on his feet as he strode toward Asahi, grinning from ear to ear. He drew his sword in a smooth, confident motion, the metal gleaming in the light.</p>

<p>Asahi, on the other hand, had been standing with the blankest face possible. His inner thoughts, however, were a different story. What… the hell just happened? Did they just decide my opponent with rock paper scissors? Is this real life? Is this a school or a circus?</p>

<p>He shook himself back to his senses just as the don approached. With a steady breath, he pulled his own sword free, the familiar weight grounding him.</p>

<p>Around them, the students hurried to clear the area, forming a wide circle. Excited whispers and murmurs filled the air, anticipation buzzing through the room.</p>

<p>The commoner don twirled his sword with a flourish. “Don’t hold back, special student.”</p>

<p>Asahi tightened his grip. Yeah, easy for you to say…</p>
