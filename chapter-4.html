<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 4 – BY A THREAD</div>

<p>Asahi pressed himself against the tree, his chest heaving, wounds burning, eyes locked on the massive snake. Its forked tongue flicked in and out, tasting the air around him, and its black, unblinking eyes never left his trembling form.</p>

<p>It's coming for me… it's coming for me…</p>

<p>Branches snapped under the snake's massive coils as it slithered closer. Every step shook the ground beneath him. His mind raced.</p>

<p>I'm not ready… I can't fight it… I'm going to die here…</p>

<p>"I'm sorry… mother… father… and you little brats… I joined you too fast… I shouldn't have…"</p>

<p>His voice was barely a whisper, lost to the hiss of the forest. His hands shook, and he pressed them together, as if the air itself could carry his apology to the family and friends he had lost.</p>

<p>The snake's head loomed larger and larger, a living wall of scales and teeth, its gaze fixed on him like a predator that had already decided the hunt. Every instinct in Asahi's body screamed to run, but his feet refused.</p>

<p>Please… just a little mercy…</p>

<p>The snake stopped mere steps from him. Time seemed to slow, the forest holding its breath. Asahi could feel the heat of its massive body, hear the rasping of its breath, smell the musky scent of its scales.</p>

<p>And then, slowly, almost lazily, it slithered to the side. Its massive body undulated past him, brushing close enough to send leaves and dirt flying, but never striking. Its black eyes flicked briefly to him and then moved on, leaving him untouched.</p>

<p>It… it's… gone…</p>

<p>Asahi sank to the forest floor, his knees giving out, trembling and soaked in sweat and blood. He pressed his face to the dirt, panting.</p>

<p>"I… I can't believe it… it just… it just passed me…"</p>

<p>Relief washed over him like a tidal wave, heavier than anything he had ever felt. His wounds, his exhaustion, even the fear that had gripped him moments ago seemed to melt away under the sheer weight of survival.</p>

<p>Thank you… thank you… I'm alive…</p>

<div class="narrator">In the forests of Ironfang, moments of terror can shift to relief in the blink of an eye. Asahi had stared death in the face and been spared, but the forest was far from done teaching him its cruel lessons. Every shadow, every rustle of leaves reminded him that survival was never guaranteed, and even the smallest chance could become a lifeline. The boy had survived, but the wild held many more trials, and none of them would wait.</div>

<p>Asahi sank against a fallen log, finally letting his body relax. His breathing was still ragged, and the cuts on his arms and legs throbbed painfully. Then, a sudden, awkward realization hit him.</p>

<p>Wait… oh no… did I just…?</p>

<p>He looked down at his pants, cheeks heating as he realized that in the panic of running from the snake, he had peed himself.</p>

<p>"Ugh… seriously? Me? Now?"</p>

<p>Grumbling, he dragged his soggy pants to a nearby stream. The cold water hit his hands as he started scrubbing at the fabric, splashing water everywhere. Every time he wrung the pants out, more dirt and grime fell into the stream.</p>

<p>What the hell kind of forest is this? First a giant spider, now a snake bigger than my house, and I'm here… washing my own pants?</p>

<p>Asahi shook his head and splashed water onto his face, trying to rinse off both the grime and his embarrassment.</p>

<p>And what are these monsters anyway? Are there even any rules in this place? Can't a guy just walk through a forest without nearly dying every five minutes?</p>

<p>The pants in the water went through several cycles of splashing, scrubbing, and wringing. Asahi huffed, grumbling to himself, occasionally slipping on the wet rocks and flailing to keep balance, letting out muffled curses each time.</p>

<p>"Stupid pants… stupid forest… stupid monsters… and stupid me…"</p>

<p>Finally, after what felt like hours, the pants were marginally cleaner and at least not completely soaked with a combination of fear, sweat, and other… substances. Asahi hung them on a low branch, glaring at the forest as if it had personally offended him.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's right. Look at me. I survived a giant spider, almost got eaten by a snake, and now I'm washing my pants like some kind of idiot. Great. Absolutely great.</p>

<p>After finishing with his pants, Asahi trudged deeper into the forest, still sore and tired. He spotted a sturdy tree with low, thick branches and decided it would make a good vantage point and safe spot to eat.</p>

<p>He climbed up carefully, settling on a wide branch that jutted out over a small clearing. From earlier, he had managed to catch a couple of fish in a shallow stream nearby. They were small, but enough to keep him alive for the time being.</p>

<p>Using a few dry twigs and leaves, he quickly sparked a tiny fire, cooking the fish just enough. The flames licked at the edges of the twigs and then died down, leaving a thin wisp of smoke curling into the air.</p>

<p>"Alright… not gourmet, but it'll do," he muttered, biting into the first fish. Its warmth and slightly smoky taste felt like a miracle after the chaos of the day.</p>

<p>As he chewed, he scanned the forest below, thinking carefully.</p>

<p>I was ridiculously lucky today. That spider, the snake… if I had hesitated one second longer, it would have been over. This luck won't last. I need a plan. I need to survive.</p>

<p>He looked at the thin smoke rising from the recently extinguished fire and frowned.</p>

<p>I can't leave too many traces… I need to stay hidden, stay alert. Every step from here on out matters. I need to get stronger, learn how to fight, and maybe… just maybe, make it out of this forest alive.</p>

<p>He finished the fish and stared out at the dense trees, the shadows shifting and rustling in the wind. The forest had already taught him one brutal lesson: survival was about more than courage—it was about cunning, planning, and accepting just how fragile life could be.</p>

<p>Okay… today was a miracle. Tomorrow… tomorrow I need to be ready.</p>

<p>He wiped his hands, glanced at the faint smoke drifting upward, and leaned back on the branch. For the first time in hours, he allowed himself a moment to catch his breath, his mind already racing with strategies for what would come next.</p>

<p>Asahi chewed the last of the fish and stared into the shadowed trees, mind racing. He had no sword, almost no magic, and his body felt like it belonged to someone much older than his years. If he did not find a weapon soon, death was not a possibility — it was a certainty.</p>

<p>I lost my wooden sword back when I ran. And even if I still had it, it would look more like a broomstick after that fight. I am weak. I have almost no magic. I need metal. I need a real blade.</p>

<p>"Alright… think."</p>

<p>He scanned the clearing, replaying the day. Kobolds scavenged and kept rusty gear. If a kobold had a dagger or broken sword, that would be an upgrade. Maybe not glorious, but better than splinters and hope.</p>

<p>If a half-rotten wooden stick could hurt that kobold, then a sharp stone on a spear should do it even better. Hit, pull, stab. Simple physics. Not heroic, but practical.</p>

<p>He dropped quietly from the branch, landing with a soft thud, and moved into the bushes. He picked his way through the undergrowth, eyes peeled for tracks and disturbed soil. His hands were numb with cold and adrenaline, but he felt oddly calm. Plans are small victories.</p>

<p>"Find a kobold. Get a sword. Don't die."</p>

<p>He found a straight, sturdy stick not long after, about as thick as his wrist and long enough to use as a spear. He knelt and searched for a sharp stone, finally prying one loose from a cluster of gravel. It was jagged but had a good edge. Using a strip ripped from his shirt, he lashed the stone to the stick, jamming bark wedges between the binding to keep it from slipping. He tied, tugged, and tied again until the stone sat tight, only the tip exposed.</p>

<p>It's crude. It's ugly. But it will cut and it will reach. That is enough for now.</p>

<p>He tested the spear with a practice thrust into a rotten stump. The stone bit in, leaving a clean slit. He grinned, a tired, filthy grin.</p>

<p>"Okay, spear works."</p>

<p>His makeshift weapon felt solid in his hands in a way the broken wooden sword never had. He tightened the last knot and slung the spear over his shoulder, then crouched low to listen. Somewhere to the left, faint chattering and clinking told him kobolds might be nearby.</p>

<p>One kobold. Quick, quiet, and take the rusty blade. No heroics. No theatrics. Just don't get eaten.</p>

<p>He moved off into the trees, spear ready, breath steadying into a hunter's rhythm born of necessity rather than skill.</p>

<p>Asahi moved along the branches, careful to keep his weight balanced and silent. The faint chattering and the glint of metal grew louder ahead.</p>

<p>Okay… slow. Quiet. Don't make a sound.</p>

<p>Peering through the leaves, he spotted them: three kobolds, huddled together. Each one brandished a weapon.</p>

<p>Rusty dagger… pathetic. Rusty sword… better, but still nothing.</p>

<p>He exhaled sharply through his nose at the third weapon.</p>

<p>Wait… that one… that's not bad. Barely rusted. That's… that's a proper sword. Did some adventurer fall recently? Or maybe they scavenged it from a campsite. Either way… that's trouble.</p>

<p>He crouched lower, trying to steady his pulse. Three kobolds, one of them with a decent blade. A direct fight would be risky.</p>

<p>I can't take all three at once. But… if I strike one… then there's only two left. I can handle two. My Fire Thrust is stronger now, and I have a stone spear instead of that pathetic wooden sword. I can do this. I have to do this.</p>

<p>He adjusted his grip on the spear, eyes locked on the closest kobold. His muscles tensed, ready to spring.</p>

<p>One perfect leap… surprise attack… and then finish the others quickly. Timing is everything. No mistakes…</p>

<p>Asahi crouched, ready to launch himself from the branch at any second.</p>

<div class="narrator">The forest was silent around him, the leaves holding their breath as if aware of the decision hanging in the air. Three small shadows below, completely unaware of the hunter perched above, moved and whispered among themselves. One leap, one sudden strike, could determine the course of life or death. Ironfang Woods did not forgive hesitation and did not reward recklessness. Every second stretched, every heartbeat thundered like a drum, and the smallest mistake could mean annihilation. Above them, the boy waited, muscles coiled, mind calculating, and fear and determination warring inside him. The moment had arrived. Whatever happened next would decide if he survived to see another sunrise or became yet another shadow lost in the relentless hunger of the wild.</div>
