<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 32 – S RANK BATTLE</div>

<p>Reina raised her hand slightly, her tone calm but firm. "Begin."</p>

<p>The moment the word left her lips, Asahi's aura flared. The air rippled violently around him as his body glowed faintly crimson. His muscles tightened, eyes sharpened, and the ground beneath his feet cracked ever so slightly.</p>

<p>Akari's lips curled into a grin. "He's not holding back at all."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded quickly, eyes wide. "He went full augmentation right from the start…"</p>

<p>Reina's hair fluttered from the force, her eyes lighting up with intrigue. "Oh?" she said, her lips curving into a faint smile. "An augmenter, huh?"</p>

<p>She shifted her stance, her blade rising effortlessly into a ready guard. "It's been a while since I've fought one who actually knew what they were doing."</p>

<p>Asahi's mind sharpened to a razor's edge. She's strong. I can feel it just from her posture.</p>

<p>The air between them tightened like a drawn bowstring—one moment of stillness before the storm.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes narrowed as he sized up Reina. I didn't exactly go all out against Kenzo. Back then I used full-body augmentation, sure, but there was more I could've done.</p>

<p>He thought through the possibilities with a calm, calculating focus. I could coat myself more heavily in magic, at a rate equal to the refill limit Master set. That would boost my power without draining my reserves. Or… I could push each part of my body I use to the absolute maximum, while keeping the previous thin augmentation active to maintain balance and speed.</p>

<p>A faint smile tugged at his lips. Today… I'm going to do both.</p>

<p>He flexed his fingers, feeling the surge of energy crawl along every fiber of his being. His eyes glowed gold as the layers of augmentation stacked, magic flowing in perfect rhythm with his body. The air around him vibrated with intensity, a low hum that promised devastation.</p>

<p>She's strong… but this is going to be a proper test of everything I've got.</p>

<p>Asahi took a deep breath, letting the hum of his magic resonate through every fiber of his being. He decided on his method: augment himself at roughly ninety percent of his refill rate, just enough to stay sustainable, while pushing each body part used in his movements to a full one hundred percent output. Every strike, every dodge, every step would be amplified to the absolute limit, layered on top of the residual base augmentation.</p>

<p>The arena seemed to pulse with his power, faint trails of gold and crimson energy following his movements even before he made them.</p>

<p>Narrator:</p>

<p>What Asahi was doing was considered utterly impossible by any ordinary person. To maintain such heavy augmentation while layering full-power output on active movements should have been suicidal, but Asahi didn't know—or perhaps didn't care—that it was impossible. To him, this was simply the path to being strong enough. A genius with extraordinary understanding, yet burdened with a tragically small pool of magic, he was forced to push every limit. And when a mind like his eventually finds a way to combine genius with a replenishing magic pool, the results are not just strong—they become extraordinary beyond imagination.</p>

<p>The moment Asahi's eyes locked onto Reina, the air seemed to snap. Time slowed in his mind, every detail sharpened—the subtle shift of her shoulders, the glint of her blade, the faint hum of her magic in the air.</p>

<p>Then, like a coiled spring released, the fight erupted.</p>

<p>Asahi surged forward, leaving faint streaks of gold fire trailing from his hands. He launched a fire swing, the blade of flame cutting through the air with a roar. Reina met it with a precise parry, sparks flying where fire kissed steel. Before she could react again, he twisted his body and unleashed a double fire swing, arcs of blazing light slicing toward her from two angles at once.</p>

<p>Akari's eyes widened. "Whoa… he's going all out!"</p>

<p>Sasaki whispered, nearly bouncing on the balls of his feet, "Big bro… this is insane! He's moving faster than I can even track!"</p>

<p>Reina's expression shifted from calm assessment to keen interest. So this is the augmenter they warned me about, she thought, her grip tightening on her sword. Every swing, thrust, and dodge carried lethal precision and overwhelming speed. She realized instantly that she had to take him seriously—this was no ordinary support candidate.</p>

<p>Asahi didn't stop. With a flick of his wrist, a fire thrust shot forward like a spear, forcing Reina to leap back, narrowly avoiding its searing tip. The very air around him seemed alive, trembling from the force of layered augmentations and the magic coating his arms.</p>

<p>Narrator:</p>

<p>Each attack was a symphony of controlled chaos. Fire swings and thrusts intertwined in a rhythm only Asahi could maintain, while the residual augmentation kept his speed and reflexes razor-sharp. Sparks flew, energy flared, and even the seasoned S-rank adventurer could not dismiss a single strike.</p>

<p>Akari's wind swirled faintly around her as she watched, jaw tight. He's refined his fire techniques… and the speed—he's faster than I expected. Reina's going to have to push herself.</p>

<p>Sasaki's voice was barely audible over the clash, but excitement dripped from every word. "Look at him! That's my big bro! No one moves like that!"</p>

<p>Reina parried a triple fire swing, sparks showering the arena like a miniature fireworks display. "Interesting…" she murmured, eyes narrowing as she adjusted her stance. "He's layering power while keeping mobility. Most would falter under this strain."</p>

<p>Asahi leapt back, eyes blazing gold. I'm not holding anything back today. She's strong, but I need to see how far she can push herself.</p>

<p>He spun, launching a whirling fire swing, then immediately followed with a fire thrust aimed at her midsection. Reina barely deflected it, stepping aside with a precision that would have seemed casual if not for the searing heat brushing past her armor.</p>

<p>Akari muttered, almost to herself, "He's insane… and he's having fun."</p>

<p>Sasaki leaned closer to Asahi mentally, heart racing, I've never seen him fight like this. Every move is perfect, yet unpredictable. He's a storm!</p>

<p>Reina's eyes sparkled with rare intensity, the first real challenge of the day laid out before her. "Finally," she whispered, sword raised. "I thought I'd have an easy time… not today."</p>

<p>The battle escalated, sparks and fire arcs colliding with silver steel, leaving trails of energy, heat, and raw power in every direction. The arena itself seemed alive with their movements, a clash of genius and experience, speed and precision.</p>

<p>The arena trembled under the force of Asahi and Reina's clashing powers. What was supposed to be a simple one-minute trial quickly escalated into something entirely different. Sparks leapt like miniature lightning storms, fire swirled with wind and magic in spirals of heat, and the shockwaves from their blows rattled the very walls of the guild hall.</p>

<p>Asahi propelled himself with explosive force, layering fire swings, double swings, thrusts, and spinning attacks, each one faster and more precise than the last. Reina responded in kind, her sword slicing through fire arcs with a gleam of silver, deflecting with perfect timing while sending gusts of air to counter every thrust. Each strike sent waves of pressure outward, and for a moment, it seemed as if the arena itself was warping under their combined energy.</p>

<p>Akari and Sasaki could only gape. Akari's wind magic stirred uncontrollably around her, almost mirroring Asahi's movements in admiration. "I… I didn't think he could push this far," she murmured, jaw tight with excitement.</p>

<p>Sasaki, nearly bouncing in place, whispered frantically, "Big bro… this is unreal! Every strike, every move—he's a living weapon!"</p>

<p>Asahi's mind raced, every thought honed like a sharpened blade. She's fast, precise, and she's keeping up… but I need to see how far she can push herself.</p>

<p>Reina's eyes glimmered with rare intensity, almost childlike in her excitement. "So, this is what an augmenter looks like at peak performance," she said, blocking a massive fire strike. "I was expecting challenge… but this is fun!"</p>

<p>They moved faster than eyes could follow. Sparks ignited the air as fire arcs clashed with silver steel. The ground cracked under the sheer force of footwork and shockwaves. Every blow that landed was followed by another, faster, more complex than the last. The fight was no longer a trial—it was a spectacle of power, intelligence, and sheer thrill.</p>

<p>Asahi let out a roar of exhilaration, spinning into a whirlwind of fire swings, while Reina countered with a fluid barrage of strikes, each one perfectly timed and angled to challenge him without holding back. Both were smiling—genuine, unrestrained smiles, caught in the pure joy of testing themselves against someone equally skilled.</p>

<p>Narrator:</p>

<p>What was meant to be a one-minute trial had long since been forgotten. Observers were lost in awe, Akari and Sasaki frozen in wide-eyed amazement. Every strike, every parry, every counter was a masterpiece of combat and magic intertwined. Sparks danced, air crackled, and heat warped the atmosphere. This was no ordinary examination—this was a clash of titans, a storm of human ingenuity and raw power.</p>

<p>Just as Asahi launched a triple fire swing, leaving streaks of molten light across the arena, Reina countered with a blinding flurry of blade strikes, the shockwave throwing them both back. They landed several meters apart, breathing heavily, grinning like rivals enjoying a duel with no end.</p>

<p>Before either could launch another strike, a sharp voice cut through the air like a blade. "Enough!"</p>

<p>Both froze mid-motion, eyes snapping toward the figure that had just appeared at the edge of the arena. It was a tall, imposing woman with silver hair tied in a severe bun and piercing amber eyes. Her presence radiated authority, yet there was an unmistakable warmth beneath it.</p>

<p>"Headmaster!" Asahi, Reina, Akari, and Sasaki all spoke in unison, though each for a different reason—shock, recognition, and in some cases, awe.</p>

<p>The headmaster's gaze swept over the scorched arena, the smoke still swirling from fire and shockwaves. "I don't care if this is a trial. You're testing limits far beyond what is necessary. Stop this immediately."</p>

<p>Asahi lowered his hands, fire dissipating, yet the gold glow in his eyes lingered. Reina relaxed her stance, her smile unchanged but tempered with respect.</p>

<p>Akari whispered to Sasaki, barely containing her excitement, "That was insane… I've never seen him fight like that before."</p>

<p>The headmaster stood, arms crossed, eyes scanning the three of them with quiet intensity. "Reina," she said, her voice carrying authority, "do these three even need a third trial?"</p>

<p>Reina's eyes followed Asahi's lingering golden glow from the fight, then flicked to Akari and Sasaki. She exhaled slowly, a faint smile on her lips. "Honestly… no. There aren't even monsters strong enough to test them properly. Any normal trial would be meaningless."</p>

<p>The headmaster's gaze sharpened. "Then what are their ranks? If the trial is unnecessary, at least I need a proper assessment."</p>

<p>Reina and the previous examiner stood on either side of a polished oak desk. Behind it sat the guild manager, a man whose very presence radiated power. Even from a distance, Sasaki could feel it and whispered under his breath, "He's an S rank… a living legend."</p>

<p>The headmaster occupied the guest seat at the side, arms folded as the three students—Asahi, Akari, and Sasaki—stood behind her, straight-backed and tense yet composed.</p>

<p>The guild manager's gaze swept over them. "Reina, give me your assessment. Rank them as you see fit."</p>

<p>Reina paused a moment, looking at each of them in turn. "Akari has impeccable elemental control, refined instincts, and quick adaptability. Her attacks are precise but her endurance under prolonged augmentation isn't fully tested. Mid A rank seems appropriate."</p>

<p>Her eyes shifted to Sasaki. "He's specialized in alchemy, but his recent improvements in combat tactics and traps show remarkable ingenuity. He can manipulate the battlefield like a master, but raw elemental power is still limited. Mid A rank also suits him."</p>

<p>Finally, her gaze settled on Asahi. "And him…" she said softly, a trace of awe in her voice. "His speed, layered augmentation, adaptability, and pure battlefield intelligence put him beyond normal assessment. Low S rank is fitting, though in actual combat, he may surpass even this. His potential is extraordinary."</p>

<p>Asahi's jaw tightened slightly, a mixture of pride and quiet focus in his expression. Akari exchanged a glance with him, impressed but unfazed. Sasaki's eyes were wide, almost sparkling, whispering under his breath, "Big bro… low S rank… that's insane."</p>

<p>The guild manager leaned back, fingers steepled. "Very well. Document their ranks and prepare them for the next stage of real-world missions. They've earned this acknowledgment."</p>

<p>The headmaster nodded slightly, a rare smile tugging at her lips. "Exceptional. None of them will be easy to handle in the field… but that's exactly what I was hoping for."</p>
