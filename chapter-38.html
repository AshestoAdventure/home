<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 38 – LET THE TOURNAMENT BEGIN!</div>

<p>The massive golden doors of the royal court creaked open, the echo rippling through the vast marble hall. The headmaster and guild master stepped inside, their footsteps steady and heavy with purpose. Rows of armored soldiers stood at attention on either side, their polished spears glinting in the sunlight that streamed through the stained glass windows.</p>

<p>At the far end, upon a raised dais, sat the king — his expression composed but shadowed by concern. Beside him stood the prime minister, hands clasped behind his back, sharp eyes flicking between the two visitors as they approached.</p>

<p>The air was thick with formality and tension, as though everyone in the room already knew this wasn't a casual visit.</p>

<p>The two walked steadily across the gleaming marble floor until they stood before the throne. Both the headmaster and guild master lowered themselves respectfully, bowing deeply.</p>

<p>"Raise your heads," the king's calm yet commanding voice echoed through the chamber. His tone carried the weight of someone who had long expected bad news. "What brings you here?"</p>

<p>The headmaster straightened and spoke first. "Your Majesty, we've received word from Lisa. They're making their move. The organization is definitely targeting the tournament this time around."</p>

<p>The guild master's face hardened. "Lisa herself is currently occupied—she's engaged with one of the Seven as we speak."</p>

<p>For a moment, silence filled the throne room. The king leaned back slightly, his expression turning grave. "I see…" he murmured after a long pause. "I had a feeling this would happen. The timing was too perfect to be coincidence."</p>

<p>The king's gaze hardened, the weight of statecraft settling over the chamber. "Calling off the grand tournament would look diplomatically catastrophic," he said slowly. "Nations and noble houses expect it. Cancelling now hands our enemies exactly the political leverage they want. That is not an option."</p>

<p>Silence fell for a heartbeat as the implications landed. The headmaster bowed her head slightly, then met the king's eyes. "Understood, Your Majesty. Then we must secure the event and root out any threat before it reaches full strength."</p>

<p>The guild master's jaw tightened. "We'll fortify the venue, increase patrols, and place discreet sentinels among the competitors. If they intend to strike publicly, we will be ready to answer."</p>

<p>The king nodded once, deliberate. "Good. Coordinate with Lisa where possible. Keep this contained—public calm is essential. Inform me of any developments immediately."</p>

<p>Both the headmaster and the guild master gave formal acknowledgements and stepped back, the plan set in motion even as the court watched with quiet, growing apprehension.</p>

<p>The king leaned back on his throne, fingers drumming thoughtfully on the armrest. "Even so," he said with a faint smile, "I expected Lisa to be able to handle at least two of them with her strength."</p>

<p>The headmaster shook her head gently. "She does, Your Majesty. In direct combat, she holds the upper hand. But she's also dealing with that envoy's subordinates. She can't afford to go all out without knowing where the others are hiding. It's a delicate balance."</p>

<p>The king chuckled quietly. "Even Lisa has her hands full this time, hm?"</p>

<p>The headmaster simply smiled, neither agreeing nor denying.</p>

<p>The guild master crossed his arms and added with a hint of dry humor, "Well, this time, if things do get out of hand, we'll be expecting His Majesty's help as well."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister's face turned red with outrage. "How rude! You cannot expect royalty to fight like a mere soldier—"</p>

<p>But the king raised a hand, silencing him instantly. His tone was calm, but the authority behind it was absolute. "Enough. If things truly spiral out of control, then yes—this time, the three of us, Lisa, and the captain of the knights will have to stand together. No one else in the kingdom can face the envoys."</p>

<p>The court fell utterly silent. Even the Prime Minister could only bow his head, realizing the weight of the moment.</p>

<p>The cafeteria was unusually lively that morning. The air buzzed with excitement and tension—everyone could feel the tournament drawing near.</p>

<p>Asahi sat at his usual spot, scarfing down his breakfast like a soldier preparing for war. Across from him, Akari stirred her tea absentmindedly while Sasaki meticulously arranged his toast and eggs like he was performing surgery.</p>

<p>"So," Sasaki said finally, breaking the silence, "two days till the big tournament."</p>

<p>Akari sighed, leaning back in her chair. "I can't believe how fast it came. Feels like we just started training yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Asahi said with a grin, "and somehow I still feel like I'm gonna get my head kicked in."</p>

<p>Sasaki smirked. "Confidence, big bro. You'll need that more than muscle."</p>

<p>Akari nodded, smiling faintly. "Still… it's exciting, isn't it? All the best students in one place, real competition."</p>

<p>Asahi's grin widened. "Can't wait to see how strong everyone's gotten. Especially Haruto…"</p>

<p>The moment he said the name, both Akari and Sasaki froze.</p>

<p>Sasaki sighed. "Let's just hope you don't wake up in your bed again this time."</p>

<p>Asahi chuckled awkwardly. "Yeah… let's hope."</p>

<p>Akari tilted her head, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "So… do you have something up your sleeve for Haruto, Asahi?"</p>

<p>Asahi smirked, taking a bite of his bread. "A few tricks. Nothing too crazy… yet."</p>

<p>Sasaki, adjusting his glasses nervously, chimed in, "And you two? Any plans for upgrading your ranks before the tournament?"</p>

<p>Akari's eyes gleamed. "This time, the goal is top five."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded firmly, a hint of determination breaking through his usual shyness. "Yeah… top five. No half measures."</p>

<p>Asahi looked between them, a small grin tugging at his lips. "Then we're all on the same page. Let's make it count."</p>

<p>The assembly hall buzzed with anticipation, students whispering nervously as all the teachers and officers stood lined up at the front. The headmaster stepped forward, her presence immediately commanding silence. Raising her hands, she traced intricate patterns in the air across her face, though to the students it looked like a simple gesture. The moment her hands fell, her voice projected clearly across the hall, carrying to every ear without a hint of strain.</p>

<p>Sasaki's eyes widened, and he muttered under his breath, "As expected of the headmaster… she doesn't even need an incantation for an advanced spell like noise amplification."</p>

<p>The headmaster began, her tone firm and crisp. "The time has finally come for the tournament. All students registered are to compete under the following rules. Weapons of any kind are permitted. All equipment is allowed, provided it adheres to safety standards. Each match will have a time limit of ten minutes. Should the time be exceeded, judges will determine the winner based on overall performance and strategy."</p>

<p>She paused, allowing the words to sink in before continuing. "Every participant must wear a safety talisman. These talismans absorb the damage inflicted during combat and transfer it onto the combat reservoirs positioned around the arena. These reservoirs, made of enchanted crystal, are designed to take on and withstand immense force. Should a reservoir shatter, the corresponding participant will be declared the loser."</p>

<p>The hall was silent for a moment as the students processed the rules, some nervously adjusting their talismans. The headmaster's eyes swept the room, sharp and piercing, making it clear that the tournament was not to be taken lightly.</p>

<p>The headmaster's gaze softened slightly as she let out a small, approving nod. "That is all. I wish each of you the very best of luck. Compete with honor, and may your skills and determination shine."</p>

<p>A murmur of excitement and tension rippled through the hall as the students exchanged glances, the weight of the upcoming battles settling in.</p>

<p>Asahi shifted uncomfortably, tugging at his sleeves as his stomach did an awkward little flip. Okay… stay calm, Asahi. You've faced S-rank level opponents before… but somehow this feels ten times worse. Maybe I should've practiced more… or eaten more… or… maybe I should just pretend I'm invisible.</p>

<p>He glanced at Akari and Sasaki, who were calmly chatting, completely unbothered. Of course… they already survived this once. Top ten first years… no sweat.</p>

<p>Swallowing his nervousness, he leaned toward them and whispered, "Any advice? Something that'll stop me from embarrassing myself?"</p>

<p>Akari smirked slightly. "Relax. Just focus on your strengths and trust your instincts. You've come this far, Asahi."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded quietly, giving him a small thumbs-up. "Yeah… don't overthink it. You've got this… big bro."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened at the "big bro," but he swallowed the nervous lump in his throat and tried to nod confidently. Okay… focus. Don't get squashed. That's step one.</p>
