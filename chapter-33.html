<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 33 – PRACTICE DUEL</div>

<p>The dining hall was louder than usual that night, filled with chatter and glances that all seemed to point toward one table. Wherever Asahi walked, whispers followed like an echo.</p>

<p>He sat down with his tray, trying to ignore the stares burning into his back. Rumors sure travel fast, he thought, picking at his food. I only got ranked a few hours ago… do these people even breathe between gossip sessions?</p>

<p>Akari sipped her drink and gave him a teasing look. "Well, this much attention was bound to happen. The last time a first-year was ranked S was about thirty years ago."</p>

<p>Asahi looked up, curious. "Thirty years? Who was it?"</p>

<p>Sasaki leaned in, eyes wide with that familiar spark of excitement. "That would be the current king. And he's the father of Ryunosuke—the Don of the nobles."</p>

<p>Asahi groaned, dropping his spoon. Wonderful, he thought, I didn't just stand out… I've officially painted a royal target on my back.</p>

<p>Akari smirked, resting her chin on her hand. "You wanted to stay out of the spotlight, remember? How's that working out for you, oh mighty S-rank?"</p>

<p>Asahi sighed, leaning back. "Like trying to take a nap during a thunderstorm."</p>

<p>The royal palace stood like a monument carved out of legend itself. Massive white spires pierced the sky, their marble walls veined with streaks of gold that shimmered under the moonlight. Great chandeliers of enchanted crystal bathed the corridors in soft radiance, and the banners of the royal house fluttered gently in the still air—each embroidered with the blazing crest of a lion crowned in flame.</p>

<p>Inside, the halls were lined with towering statues of past monarchs, their eyes seemingly alive, watching every soul that dared walk beneath their gaze. Behind all that grandeur, deep within the heart of the palace, lay the royal study—a vast chamber lit by golden candelabras and walls covered in shelves overflowing with old tomes and scrolls of ancient law and arcane history.</p>

<p>The king sat alone behind a heavy mahogany desk, a stack of parchment before him, his hand resting thoughtfully on his chin. His eyes—sharp and gold like tempered sunlight—flicked toward the corner of the room as a faint ripple of air disturbed the silence.</p>

<p>A figure cloaked entirely in black appeared on one knee, head bowed low in reverence.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," the spy said, voice muffled through the mask.</p>

<p>The king didn't move for a moment, simply watching the man as though he'd already guessed his purpose. Then, in a calm, commanding tone, he asked, "Did something happen?"</p>

<p>The spy kept his head bowed, voice low but steady. "Yes, Your Majesty. It concerns the Royal Academy."</p>

<p>The king's fingers stilled atop the parchment. "Go on."</p>

<p>"A student—first year—was awarded an S rank by the Adventurers' Guild today."</p>

<p>The air in the study seemed to tighten. The king slowly leaned back in his chair, his golden eyes narrowing. "A first year… S rank?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sire," the spy continued. "It caused quite the commotion within the guild. Reports say even the headmaster and the SS-ranked guild master were present during the evaluation. The name of the student… is Asahi. A commoner."</p>

<p>For a moment, the only sound was the faint crackle of the fireplace. Then, a small, knowing smile formed on the king's lips.</p>

<p>"A commoner, you say…" He rested his chin on his hand, thoughtful. "Interesting. It's been three decades since someone achieved that so young."</p>

<p>The spy hesitated. "Shall I gather more information about him, Your Majesty?"</p>

<p>The king's gaze drifted toward the window, where the moonlight spilled across the polished floor like silver silk. "No… not yet. Let him grow a little more. A flame that bright will either burn out—or light the world on fire."</p>

<p>The spy bowed his head deeper. "As you command."</p>

<p>The king's eyes gleamed faintly in the candlelight. "Keep watching him… from the shadows. I want to see which one he becomes."</p>

<p>The spy reached into his cloak and produced a sealed scroll, the royal crest of the academy glinting faintly in the firelight. He extended it with both hands.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, the Headmaster requested that this be delivered to you personally."</p>

<p>The king took it without a word, breaking the wax seal with a soft crack. His eyes moved swiftly across the parchment as the flames flickered beside him, their light dancing across his sharp features.</p>

<p>When he finished, he slowly rolled the scroll shut, a quiet chuckle escaping his lips. He turned his gaze toward the nearby candle, its golden flame swaying gently in the still air.</p>

<p>"So…" he murmured, voice low and almost amused, "he's her student."</p>

<p>A glint of intrigue sparked in his eyes.</p>

<p>"That makes things… interesting."</p>

<p>Akari and Sasaki were practically glowing with excitement as they dragged Asahi down the hallway. He looked like a prisoner being escorted to his own execution.</p>

<p>"Oi, mind telling me why I'm being hauled around like luggage?" Asahi groaned.</p>

<p>"To the duel room," Akari said, grinning. "It's where students sharpen their practical skills. And where you'll see the monsters you'll be competing with in the tournament."</p>

<p>"Tournament?" Asahi raised an eyebrow. "You mean the ranking thing you two were talking about?"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Sasaki said, eyes sparkling. "It's next month. School-wide. One-on-one duels. The top 20 get recognized by the guild, and the champion—well, they get to duel an instructor."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened. "Wait, so you fight teachers? What if the teacher's in a bad mood?"</p>

<p>Akari smirked. "Then you learn faster."</p>

<p>They entered the massive duel room—glowing circles lit the floor, spells crackled in the air, and students clashed with enough force to make the ground rumble.</p>

<p>Sasaki folded his arms. "Anyway, the favorite to win this year is Haruto Blaize."</p>

<p>"Never heard of him," Asahi said. "He strong?"</p>

<p>Akari chuckled. "Strong? He once fought Kenzo and Ryunosuke together—and it ended in a draw."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked in disbelief. "Wait… Haruto took on both Kenzo and Ryunosuke—and it was a draw?"</p>

<p>Akari nodded with a grin. "Yup. That's why he's the favorite."</p>

<p>Asahi went silent for a moment, processing. He had barely beaten Kenzo himself, and that too by a hair's breadth. He knew Kenzo still had a stronger form he hadn't even used. And Ryunosuke… he was said to be just as strong.</p>

<p>"For one guy to fight both of them at once and not lose…" Asahi muttered, half to himself. "That's insane."</p>

<p>Sasaki chuckled. "Now you see why everyone calls him the prodigy of this generation."</p>

<p>Asahi sighed, scratching the back of his head. "Great. So the guy I'll probably end up fighting is basically a walking disaster."</p>

<p>Akari laughed. "Yup. Welcome to the top, Asahi."</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head. "Wait, which year is Haruto in?"</p>

<p>"Fourth," Sasaki replied casually.</p>

<p>"Fourth? There's a fourth year?" Asahi blinked. "How many years are there in total?"</p>

<p>Akari chuckled. "Technically, only three are compulsory. Most students leave after that since they've already learned everything they need. But a few stay on for advanced studies — research, specialization, that sort of thing."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded. "Yeah, only a few dozen actually remain after the third year. They're basically half-students, half-scholars. Most of them don't bother with tournaments anymore. Haruto's the only one who still does, and he crushes everyone for fun."</p>

<p>Asahi frowned. "So there aren't any other super-strong second or third years? I mean, you two got into the top 20 as first years."</p>

<p>Akari shrugged. "Well, most third years don't even participate anymore. Once they hit third year, they automatically get the same privileges as top 20 students. No reason to keep fighting."</p>

<p>Sasaki added, "Still, a few of them do stay in the rankings — Ryunosuke, Kenzo, and three others make up the current top five. But who knows? Some of them might skip this tournament altogether."</p>

<p>Asahi leaned back, whistling softly. "So basically, the ones who do show up… are the monsters who live for battle."</p>

<p>Akari smirked. "Exactly. And lucky for us, we'll be front row to the carnage."</p>

<p>Asahi, Akari, and Sasaki stepped into the duel room, only to be immediately caught in a wave of noise and excitement. A crowd had formed around something in the center, voices shouting and cheering.</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" Asahi asked, weaving through the throng.</p>

<p>Sasaki squinted, trying to get a better look. "Looks like a fight… yeah, it's Ryunosuke."</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened as he finally saw the action: Ryunosuke, calm and calculating, trading blows with another powerful-looking student whose movements were just as precise and deadly.</p>

<p>"That guy…" Asahi murmured.</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded. "That's Rensuke Illistone. Third year, top three. And, well… he's Ryunosuke's cousin."</p>

<p>Akari raised an eyebrow. "No wonder the tension is insane. Family rivalry and top three combat skills. This is going to be fun to watch."</p>

<p>Asahi muttered under his breath, eyes glued to the two combatants. "If they fight like this casually, I can't even imagine what Haruto will be like…"</p>

<p>Sasaki chuckled nervously beside him. "Yeah… don't even think about it."</p>

<p>Asahi squinted, his eyes following the rapid dance of spells. Ryunosuke and Rensuke were mostly trading magic, their hands weaving intricate patterns that sent fire, ice, and lightning screaming across the duel room. Physical blows happened occasionally, but barely—just enough to punctuate the magical barrage.</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth, fully augmented and keeping up with every movement, sparks of magic flying around him as if he were part of the fight. Still, inside, he couldn't help but whimper in a comedic, exaggerated way. The amount of magic they're throwing out… each spell is more than my entire reserve!</p>

<p>Sasaki peeked over, grinning nervously. "Yeah… their spells are insane. They barely even touch each other physically. All the real work comes from magic."</p>

<p>Asahi's jaw tightened, and he muttered under his breath, half in awe, half in comedic despair. I'm keeping up, I am, but seriously… how do they even refill all that? My head hurts just thinking about it.</p>

<p>The duel room shook as Ryunosuke and Rensuke unleashed their magic. Spells collided midair, sending shockwaves that rattled the walls and made the ceiling shimmer with raw energy. Fireballs exploded into cascades of flame that split into shards of molten rock, while streaks of ice shot like blades across the room, shattering into glittering shards as they collided with arcs of lightning. Each spell left behind a lingering aura of power, heating the air and leaving the scent of ozone and scorched stone.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened, fully augmented, every nerve alive with the speed of the magic being thrown. He could keep up, dodging and weaving through the torrents of elemental destruction, his own flames and thrusts slicing through lingering sparks, leaving trails of fire that crackled and danced. Each swing of his fire, each thrust and double-swing, met with mirrored precision, creating a symphony of collision that sent miniature shockwaves through the arena.</p>

<p>He watched as Ryunosuke sent a concentrated blast of lightning, aimed to pierce Rensuke's ice barrier, which shattered spectacularly, spraying shards into the air. Rensuke retaliated with a spiraling fire vortex, twisting around the lightning's path and erupting in a massive explosion that shook the spectators back against the walls. Sparks, embers, shards of ice, and arcs of raw lightning collided midair like titans clashing, sending waves of heat and force rolling across the room.</p>

<p>Asahi, still standing on the sidelines, muttered under his breath in a mix of awe and comedic despair. The energy in each spell… it's more than my entire reserves! He clenched his fists, feeling the hum of magic around him. His augmented senses traced every flick of their fingers, every subtle movement, every trajectory of fire and lightning. I could follow it… I can follow it… but inside I'm crying.</p>

<p>Sasaki's eyes were wide as he whispered, "This… this is insane. They're barely touching each other physically, and still the power… it's unreal."</p>

<p>Akari leaned forward, smirking, clearly enjoying the display. "See? This is why top third years are terrifying. And family rivalry? That just turns it into a storm."</p>

<p>The battle escalated further. Ryunosuke conjured a wall of jagged ice spikes that tore across the room, while Rensuke melted part of it with a sweeping arc of fire, sending molten ice raining down. Lightning crackled between them, arcing across the floor and leaving scorch marks where it struck. The ceiling glimmered with residual magic, and the walls vibrated with every impact.</p>

<p>Asahi's internal commentary continued, half-amused, half-panicked. I can keep up… my augmented mode can handle this… but the sheer scale of energy wasted… it's like watching a hurricane in a teacup and knowing the teacup is your head.</p>

<p>Sparks, arcs, and explosions kept colliding in a relentless storm of magic, the duel room now unrecognizable under the sheer magnitude of their power. Both Ryunosuke and Rensuke were smiling, faces glowing with exhilaration, their movements blurring into streaks of light and shadow as if the very air had become their battlefield.</p>

<p>Spectators were pressed to the walls, some whispering in awe, others backing away from the force of the shockwaves. The room itself seemed to tremble in acknowledgment: this wasn't a duel—it was a spectacle, a war of titans, a display of raw, chaotic genius.</p>
