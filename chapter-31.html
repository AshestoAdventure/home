<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 31 – ACED IT</div>

<p>The moment the examiner left, the room fell silent for only a second before it came alive with motion.</p>

<p>Sasaki dug through his pouch with trembling hands until he found a small violet flask. The liquid inside shimmered faintly like moonlight on water. He hesitated for half a second, then uncorked it and drank.</p>

<p>Akari glanced at him, raising an eyebrow. "You sure about that? Memorization potions can fry your brain if you overdo it."</p>

<p>Sasaki wiped his mouth and smiled nervously. "O-Only lasts an hour. Just enough time."</p>

<p>Almost immediately, his eyes glazed over with a sharp, almost unnatural focus. He spread open his stack of papers, flipping through them with mechanical precision, his gaze darting from line to line like lightning. Every page he saw, he remembered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Akari closed her eyes and whispered, "Wind—grant me sight beyond sight."</p>

<p>A faint current swirled around her as she split her awareness through the air itself. The papers around her rustled softly, as if touched by invisible hands, and multiple pages flipped open at once. Her Wind Sight allowed her to "read" the contents of every book simultaneously — diagrams, incantations, and charts flooding into her mind in parallel streams.</p>

<p>Asahi smirked. "Show-offs."</p>

<p>He pressed two fingers to his temples, channeling energy into his eyes. The faint gold glow that appeared was his signature augmentation — Eagle Focus. The world slowed, his vision sharpened, and the tiny letters on the pages became crystal clear. He began scanning line after line, devouring text faster than most people could blink.</p>

<p>Minutes passed in silence — save for the whisper of pages and the hum of magic.</p>

<p>Sasaki muttered equations under his breath, his tone eerily precise.</p>

<p>Akari's hair fluttered in the wind she controlled, her expression calm but calculating.</p>

<p>Asahi's hands moved rapidly through his notes, eyes glowing like molten gold.</p>

<p>If the examiner had peeked in just then, he would've thought he was watching three completely different species study — one mechanical, one ethereal, and one predatory.</p>

<p>The clock ticked down, marking the passing of each tense minute until the two hours were up.</p>

<p>The ticking clock finally rang with a dull ding, echoing through the quiet room.</p>

<p>Sasaki blinked hard, snapping out of his trance. His pupils slowly returned to normal, and he slumped back against the couch. "I… I think I memorized the entire library."</p>

<p>Akari chuckled softly, rubbing her temples. "My head's still spinning from all those formulas. I could feel the air vibrating with data."</p>

<p>Asahi stretched his arms, eyes dimming back to their usual shade. "Well, at least no one can say we didn't study."</p>

<p>The door creaked open just then. The examiner stepped in, carrying a clipboard. His sharp gaze swept across the trio, clearly impressed they hadn't burned out. "Time's up. Hand over your study material."</p>

<p>He stacked the notes neatly, then gestured for them to follow.</p>

<p>They walked down a corridor lined with glowing crystal lamps until they reached another chamber — smaller, colder, and eerily silent. Three desks waited, each with a sealed paper and a pen.</p>

<p>"Written assessment," the examiner said. "One hour. Covering general knowledge, elemental theory, and tactical reasoning. No magic enhancements allowed."</p>

<p>The air grew heavy. The moment he said begin, pens scratched against paper like sword clashes.</p>

<p>Sasaki's handwriting moved with precision, his potion's aftereffects still lingering just enough to recall everything.</p>

<p>Akari answered with calm confidence, diagrams forming as if the ink itself obeyed her will.</p>

<p>Asahi scribbled furiously, eyes darting between questions like a warrior scanning for weak spots.</p>

<p>When the clock struck again, the examiner collected their sheets without a word. The trio exchanged quiet glances — the unspoken question of how'd you do? lingering between them.</p>

<p>A tense few minutes passed as the examiner flipped through the papers. His eyes moved swiftly, occasionally raising an eyebrow, occasionally humming in approval.</p>

<p>Finally, he placed the last sheet down and nodded. "Alright," he said with a faint smile. "All of you passed the first stage. Not bad for a bunch of unregistered recruits."</p>

<p>Asahi exhaled in relief, while Sasaki almost fell out of his chair.</p>

<p>Akari just smirked. "Told you we'd manage."</p>

<p>The examiner straightened his coat. "Don't get too comfortable," he said, turning toward the door. "The second test starts now — the combat trial. Follow me."</p>

<p>And just like that, their next challenge began.</p>

<p>The trio entered the wide circular arena, its walls humming softly with magic. The air felt heavier here, charged with the pressure of countless past battles.</p>

<p>At the center stood a tall woman with long black hair tied neatly behind her head. Her silver armor shimmered faintly under the mana lights, every movement radiating quiet power.</p>

<p>She turned to face them, her expression unreadable. "You three must be the examinees for today."</p>

<p>Her voice was calm, yet it carried the weight of command that made even Akari straighten up slightly.</p>

<p>"I am Reina Valemont," she continued. "S-rank adventurer, and I'll be judging whether you're fit to proceed to the final stage."</p>

<p>All three froze. Even Asahi, who had no real idea what S-rank meant, could feel the air tighten.</p>

<p>Sasaki leaned closer to whisper, "An S-rank… that's insane. There are barely a handful in the entire kingdom."</p>

<p>Akari nodded slowly, eyes gleaming. "To think they'd send someone of her level for the exam…"</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, half nervous, half amazed. "So this is what real power looks like."</p>

<p>Reina raised a hand to silence their whispers. "Your task is simple," she said, her tone smooth but cold. "Each of you will face me one by one. If you can last one minute against me, you pass the combat stage."</p>

<p>Her eyes settled on Akari first. "You're up."</p>

<p>Reina motioned with her hand. "Begin."</p>

<p>The moment the word left her lips, Akari's magic flared to life. The air rippled as a surge of wind gathered around her feet. She dashed forward, faster than most eyes could follow, her blade gleaming in the light.</p>

<p>Reina raised a single arm, effortlessly blocking Akari's strike with the flat of her sword. The impact sent a sharp ring through the arena, wind exploding outward.</p>

<p>Akari didn't stop. She spun low, slicing through the air, then leapt back and sent a razor-thin crescent of wind hurtling toward Reina. The S-rank adventurer tilted her head slightly, letting the spell split the ground beside her.</p>

<p>"Good speed," Reina said softly. "But your momentum's too linear."</p>

<p>Akari grinned. "Then let's make it less predictable."</p>

<p>She stomped the ground, wind bursting beneath her boots, and instantly appeared behind Reina. For a brief moment, even the examiner's eyes flickered with surprise. Akari's sword came down in a flash—only to meet Reina's blade once again, perfectly timed.</p>

<p>The clash echoed. Sparks danced. Wind roared.</p>

<p>Seconds turned into thirty… forty… fifty. Sweat glistened on Akari's brow, but her eyes stayed sharp. She darted around Reina like a storm, striking from every angle, using bursts of wind to keep her pace unpredictable.</p>

<p>Reina barely moved her feet. Every parry, every counter was clean, efficient—almost elegant.</p>

<p>When the final second ticked away, Reina's blade met Akari's one last time with a loud crack, both women frozen in place. Then Reina stepped back and lowered her sword.</p>

<p>"One minute," she said simply.</p>

<p>Akari exhaled, catching her breath but smiling proudly.</p>

<p>Reina's expression softened. "You've done well. Your technique and control are impressive. I'd say you already fight at an A-rank level." She paused, then allowed a faint smile. "And if you keep improving like this… S-rank might not be out of reach."</p>

<p>Akari's eyes widened for a moment before she bowed respectfully. "Thank you, ma'am."</p>

<p>Sasaki whispered to Asahi from the side, "I knew she was good… but not that good."</p>

<p>Asahi smiled faintly. "Yeah. Guess we've got a real storm on our side."</p>

<p>Sasaki stepped forward nervously, adjusting the strap of his potion belt. The faint clinking of glass echoed through the training hall. Reina gave him a nod. "Ready when you are."</p>

<p>He swallowed hard, then smiled faintly. "As ready as I'll ever be."</p>

<p>Asahi leaned forward, practically buzzing with anticipation. "Finally, I get to see what he can really do," he muttered.</p>

<p>Akari smirked beside him, wiping a bead of sweat from her forehead. "You're in for a treat. He might not look like it, but once he sets things up… he's terrifying."</p>

<p>The moment Reina said, "Begin," Sasaki's demeanor changed completely. Gone was the shy alchemist. His hands moved with mechanical precision—uncorking vials, tossing small flasks across the arena floor.</p>

<p>Reina didn't move yet. She watched, curious, as the air filled with faint green mist and flickering blue sparks.</p>

<p>Asahi's eyes widened. He's… mapping the battlefield?</p>

<p>Sasaki stepped back, holding a small crystal orb that pulsed faintly with light. Reina took a step forward—and the moment her boot touched one of the green patches, it exploded in a burst of smoke.</p>

<p>Out of the cloud shot a bright red vial, breaking against her blade and detonating in a controlled fireburst. Reina barely flinched, slashing through the smoke, but Sasaki had already vanished behind a haze of shimmering dust.</p>

<p>Akari's eyes sparkled. "Oh, he's using the dust traps too? He's gotten gutsy."</p>

<p>Asahi grinned. He's not trying to overpower her—he's manipulating her movements. Every explosion, every smoke cloud—it's all part of a pattern.</p>

<p>Reina swung her sword through another burst, only to find her footing slipping as a slick purple liquid spread beneath her boots. Sasaki's voice echoed from somewhere above, "Binding mist—trigger!"</p>

<p>The smoke twisted into glowing chains that coiled toward Reina. For a split second, it almost looked like he'd caught her.</p>

<p>But Reina smiled faintly and sliced through the chains like paper. "Clever," she said, "but you're still hesitating."</p>

<p>Sasaki landed on the ground, panting but smiling. "Guess I need stronger glue."</p>

<p>The one minute ended with a shimmer as the traps faded and the last of the mist dissipated. Reina lowered her sword, a glint of respect in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Very good control," she said. "Most alchemists panic under pressure. You, on the other hand, turned the battlefield into your weapon."</p>

<p>Akari nodded in genuine admiration. "You've improved so much since our last spar."</p>

<p>Sasaki rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassed. "Heh… maybe watching Asahi fight rubbed off on me."</p>

<p>Asahi couldn't stop smiling. He's not just a support anymore. He's an entire strategy on legs.</p>

<p>Reina's gaze drifted toward Asahi, her eyes narrowing slightly. "You're next."</p>

<p>Asahi exhaled softly and stepped forward, rolling his shoulders as if shaking off invisible weight. The air around him felt heavier all of a sudden, like the room itself was waiting.</p>

<p>Akari and Sasaki had both turned silent—too silent. Their eyes were glued to Asahi, anticipation flickering like lightning in their expressions.</p>

<p>Reina noticed immediately. Her brow arched in mild curiosity. What's with those stares? she thought. They look like they're about to witness something unbelievable.</p>

<p>She glanced at the papers on her desk earlier in the day. According to the report, he's just a support candidate. No prior guild record, no elemental specialization... so why are they this eager?</p>

<p>Akari whispered under her breath, excitement barely contained. "Finally, I get to see that in action again."</p>

<p>Sasaki clenched his fists, grinning from ear to ear. "Big bro's gonna blow her mind."</p>

<p>Reina's eyes flicked between the two and then back to Asahi, who stood there calmly, his expression unreadable.</p>

<p>He gave a small, almost apologetic smile. "Guess it's my turn, huh?"</p>

<p>The examiner folded her arms. "Show me what you can do, support boy."</p>

<p>Akari smirked quietly. "Oh… you're in for a surprise."</p>
