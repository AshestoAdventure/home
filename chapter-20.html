<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 20 – LET THE CLASSES BEGIN</div>

<p>Asahi looked at the headmaster in surprise for a bit before regaining composure and greeting her.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Headmaster", he said.</p>

<p>"No need for formalities when we are alone. You can call me Toshiko" she replied.</p>

<p>Eh? It kind of feels weird to address the headmaster like that.</p>

<p>The headmaster senses his discomfort.</p>

<p>"Well, it's you call. Anyways how are you liking the school so far, Asahi?"</p>

<p>"Well, the school itself is well beyond anything I've ever seen, but I can't say I'm a fan of the social divide"</p>

<p>The headmaster pondered.</p>

<p>"Yes, this problem runs deep in the school even among the professors that teach here. We try to give equal opportunity to all, but this just can't be helped when most of the students that attend are nobility"</p>

<p>Asahi looked down.</p>

<p>So it's that big a problem here huh?</p>

<p>"Well, that's a problem for another time. I came here to talk to you about the class you'll be teaching. It's going to be an open class, meaning anyone who wishes to attend can and anyone who doesn't want to, doesn't have to."</p>

<p>That's kind of relieving. No one will probably want to join a commoner's class.</p>

<p>"We already spread the news about it and students who want to apply will send the head office letters of participation"</p>

<p>Asahi smiled in a silly manner, rubbing the back of his head,</p>

<p>"Ah, well if no one wants to join my class it's not really an issue, Headma-I mean Toshiko-No, I mean Toshiko-sama!"</p>

<p>The headmaster raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"You know what, headmaster is fine"</p>

<p>"U-Understood.."</p>

<p>"Anyways, it's not that you didn't get any applicants. It's just that you got too many"</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>"Um…by too many how much exactly do you mean?"</p>

<p>"87"</p>

<p>Asahi's jaw nearly hit the floor.</p>

<p>"E-Eighty seven?! You're joking right, Headmaster? There's no way that many people would willingly take a class taught by me!"</p>

<p>Toshiko smirked slightly, amused at his reaction. "It seems word of your duel with me spread faster than you realize. Students are curious. Some want to see if the rumors are true, others want to measure themselves against you, and a few…" She tilted her head. "…probably just want to see you fail."</p>

<p>Asahi slumped into the chair by his desk, running his hands through his hair.</p>

<p>Great… instead of no one, I ended up with a whole army of them.</p>

<p>He muttered aloud, "This isn't a class… this is a battlefield."</p>

<p>Toshiko chuckled softly. "If it makes you feel any better, the actual turnout might be a little smaller. Curiosity brings them in, but only interest keeps them there."</p>

<p>"Only interest, huh…" Asahi rubbed his chin, still looking half-dazed. "What am I even supposed to do with eighty-seven students?!"</p>

<p>"That," Toshiko said firmly, "is up to you. Teach them what you've mastered. Refined efficiency. That is the reason you're here, Asahi."</p>

<p>He groaned, leaning back until the chair nearly tipped. "I was hoping to blend in quietly… now I'm about to get trampled by a mob."</p>

<p>The Headmaster's eyes softened for a brief moment, though her tone stayed calm. "You'll manage. After all, you survived the fourth layer. Eighty-seven students shouldn't scare you more than that."</p>

<p>Asahi froze for a second, then muttered under his breath, "Honestly, it feels scarier."</p>

<p>Toshiko smiled knowingly. "That's because monsters don't gossip. Students do."</p>

<p>"Gee, thanks for the encouragement…"</p>

<p>She turned toward the door, her presence still carrying that quiet weight of authority. "Get some rest, Asahi. Tomorrow, the real test begins."</p>

<p>Asahi looked back at the glowing paper, still hovering in the middle of his room with the number 87 burned into his mind.</p>

<p>This school's going to kill me before any monster does.</p>

<p>Asahi finally reached out and plucked the glowing paper from the air. The magic dissolved as soon as it touched his hand, leaving behind an ordinary sheet with neatly inked text.</p>

<p>He scanned the words quickly, his eyes darting from line to line.</p>

<p>"Four classes a week…" he muttered aloud. "Two combat theory, one magical fundamentals, and…" his voice caught. "…one class where I'm the teacher. And of course, it's tomorrow."</p>

<p>He flopped onto his bed, holding the paper above his face. Tomorrow? Really? Not even a few days to prepare? What am I even supposed to do?</p>

<p>The schedule continued below in clean script: each class only lasted an hour, with the rest of the week left open for students to practice, train, or study independently.</p>

<p>"An hour sounds short," he sighed, "but when you're standing in front of eighty-seven students who probably hate your guts, it'll feel like a lifetime."</p>

<p>He tossed the paper onto the desk and covered his face with his hands. I survived the fourth layer, but teaching one class… that might actually kill me.</p>

<p>The paper glowed faintly again, as though mocking his despair.</p>

<p>The morning sun crept through the window, painting the room in a soft glow. Asahi stood in front of the wardrobe, tugging on his freshly pressed uniform, adjusting the collar with a sigh. His sword remained in its place, neatly stored away, though he couldn't help but glance at it now and then.</p>

<p>First day as a teacher… eighty-seven students… and no clue what I'm doing. Perfect start.</p>

<p>He checked the clock. Still an hour left before class. Maybe enough time to sit, breathe, and try to come up with something that wouldn't make him look like a complete fool.</p>

<p>That plan was cut short by a polite knock on the door.</p>

<p>Asahi blinked, then shuffled over and pulled it open. Standing there was a timid-looking boy, thin frame, spectacles sliding slightly down his nose, clutching a stack of papers like they were his lifeline.</p>

<p>"G-Good morning," the boy said nervously, bowing his head a little. "My name is Sasaki Bitralis. I was assigned to be your assistant for today's session."</p>

<p>Asahi raised an eyebrow. Bitralis… that's definitely a noble name. But he looks more like the type who loses a duel with his own shoelaces.</p>

<p>He forced a grin. "Oh… well, good morning to you too, Sasaki. I didn't know I'd be getting an assistant."</p>

<p>Sasaki adjusted his glasses quickly, almost dropping the papers in his hand. "Y-Yes, well, since this is your first class, the head office thought it would be best if someone helped with… logistics."</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head, smirking faintly. "Logistics, huh? You sure you're not just here to keep me from accidentally blowing the place up?"</p>

<p>The poor boy blinked, unsure whether to laugh or be horrified. "N-No, sir! I mean… Mister Asahi! I mean…"</p>

<p>Asahi chuckled. Definitely a noble, but he acts like a commoner who's afraid of his own shadow. What a weird combo.</p>

<p>He waved it off casually. "Relax, Sasaki. I'm not big on formalities. Let's just get through this together, yeah?"</p>

<p>The boy's shoulders eased just a little, though his grip on the papers was still tight. "Y-Yes. Together."</p>

<p>Asahi couldn't help but shake his head, amused. Great. First day of teaching and my assistant's more nervous than I am.</p>

<p>Asahi shut the door behind him and glanced at Sasaki, who was still fidgeting with the stack of papers. Then again… this might be a chance to get a good idea of how this place works and what's really happening behind the scenes.</p>

<p>He started walking down the corridor, Sasaki shuffling quickly to keep up. "So, Sasaki… what exactly are you? Just an assistant?"</p>

<p>The boy perked up a little, pushing his glasses up nervously. "Ah—no, I'm actually a special student as well. My field is alchemy. But… since hardly anyone applies for my classes, I'm often reassigned as an assistant for other special students."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. Ouch. That's… rough. He gave a small nod, trying not to let too much pity show on his face. "I see. That explains a lot."</p>

<p>Sasaki lowered his head slightly, voice quieter now. "Alchemy doesn't have the same… appeal as swordsmanship or magic combat, so most students don't bother. It's fine, though. I can still learn by helping."</p>

<p>Asahi stole a glance at him. He's trying to put a brave face on it, but that's kind of depressing. A noble name, timid attitude, and now this. Poor guy.</p>

<p>Still, he pressed on. "Well, since you know your way around, mind giving me some useful info? Anything I should be aware of before walking into a room full of eighty-seven students who probably want to laugh me out of it?"</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded quickly, adjusting his papers as if glad to be asked. "Of course! First, know that most nobles will test you, either by asking tricky questions or challenging you directly. It's… their way of measuring status. Second, the professors don't interfere in special student classes unless there's a real emergency. And third…" He hesitated, then gave Asahi a nervous smile. "You should probably prepare yourself for rumors. They spread… very fast here."</p>

<p>Asahi groaned inwardly. Great. More rumors. Just what I needed.</p>

<p>But he gave Sasaki a faint grin nonetheless. "That's actually helpful. Thanks. Guess I'll be relying on you more than I thought."</p>

<p>Sasaki blinked, startled by the casual praise, and nodded eagerly. "Y-Yes! I'll do my best!"</p>

<p>Asahi chuckled softly to himself. At least he's earnest. That might be the most useful thing of all.</p>

<p>Asahi finally reached the heavy wooden door marked with the crest of the academy. He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and pulled it open.</p>

<p>What greeted him on the other side made him freeze in the doorway.</p>

<p>The "classroom" was unlike any lecture hall he had seen. Instead of desks and chairs, the room was filled with rows of mannequins, all perfectly lined up and standing at attention. Each one held training weapons—swords, spears, staffs—and the floor was pristine, showing no signs of damage or scuffs. The faint hum of lingering magic gave the room an almost otherworldly calm.</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. "The hell…? This looks more like a training hall than a classroom."</p>

<p>Sasaki stepped in calmly, adjusting his spectacles as though nothing was out of place. "That's because it is, in a sense. All combat-oriented classes are held in these reinforced chambers. They reset overnight, mannequins replaced, floor cleaned, magic replenished. It's designed to withstand… accidents."</p>

<p>Asahi stepped inside, his boots echoing slightly against the smooth floor. Man… they weren't kidding when they said this school was on another level. Back home, we'd get scolded just for scratching a training post.</p>

<p>He turned to Sasaki. "You're telling me this is normal? Students just spar here every day, and it resets perfectly?"</p>

<p>Sasaki tilted his head slightly. "Of course. Would you rather they did it in the dormitories?"</p>

<p>Asahi opened his mouth, paused, and then shut it again. "…Fair point."</p>

<p>Still, he couldn't shake the thought. So this is where I'm supposed to 'teach.' Eighty-seven nobles, lined up neatly like this, ready to test me. Great. Just great.</p>
