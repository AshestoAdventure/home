<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 17 – THE ENTRANCE DUEL</div>

<p>Asahi tightened his grip on the sword, the polished steel gleaming under the harsh light of the duel room. The headmaster’s eyes widened as she saw it. That weapon had come from Lisa. She had trusted him with something precious, something that spoke of faith few ever received.</p>

<p>I can’t fail her. Not now.</p>

<p>The headmaster shook herself slightly, her focus snapping back to the duel.</p>

<p>“So this is the sword Lisa gave you,” she said, her voice calm but carrying an edge of intrigue. “She has more faith in you than I thought.”</p>

<p>Asahi said nothing. His eyes flicked to her, steady and unflinching.</p>

<p>Without another word, she raised her hand. The air around her seemed to thrum with energy as a massive boulder began forming at her fingertips. It grew with unnatural speed, pulsing with power, until it loomed over Asahi like a small mountain ready to crush him.</p>

<p>That’s not just strength. That’s control, precision, intent.</p>

<p>With a flick of her finger, the boulder shot forward like a comet, tearing through the space between them. Asahi’s eyes glowed as the augmentation activated, scanning the trajectory, predicting the path. Timing, angle, force. Every variable calculated in an instant.</p>

<p>She’s testing me. She wants to see if I can rise to the challenge.</p>

<p>He stepped forward, sword poised, and with a precise thrust ignited in fire, he met the boulder head-on. The stone shattered instantly, fragments flying in all directions, sparks lighting up the room. The fire on his blade seemed to slice through the massive mass effortlessly, a display of skill and instinct perfectly balanced.</p>

<p>The headmaster staggered back slightly, astonishment clear in her eyes. She had expected strength, she had expected skill, but not this. This was efficiency, control, and refined power wrapped in a single movement.</p>

<p>“You handle that…” she started, searching for words. “With an efficiency I did not anticipate. Incredible control under pressure.”</p>

<p>Asahi lowered his sword slightly, fire still licking its edge.</p>

<p>“I learned from those worth learning from,” he said steadily. “If you want to test me further, I am ready.”</p>

<p>The headmaster studied him, her mind racing. Lisa’s faith in him made sense now. This was more than just a sword or skill. It was the resolve behind them.</p>

<p>“Interesting,” she murmured finally. “Perhaps I underestimated you.”</p>

<p>She’s holding back, but how far? How strong is she really?</p>

<p>He adjusted his stance, ready for whatever she would throw at him next.</p>

<p>The headmaster’s lips curled into the faintest smile as she raised her hand again.</p>

<p>“Very well, Asahi. Let us see how far your strength truly goes.”</p>

<p>The headmaster’s fingers danced in the air, tracing complex patterns. The floor beneath them shook slightly as a strange wind stirred. Three massive shapes materialized above her, coiling and snapping their wings. Three wyverns hovered in the air, their scales glinting, claws scraping the stone floor with a low, threatening rumble.</p>

<p>Asahi’s eyes flicked between them, and a slow smirk spread across his face.</p>

<p>Three? I’ve fought far more than this in practice. This will be nothing.</p>

<p>The headmaster, however, studied him closely, her brows furrowing.</p>

<p>He moves with ease, but this… he might struggle a bit with all three at once. Let’s see how he handles it.</p>

<p>The wyverns let out synchronized screeches, and the air thickened with the smell of ozone and heated air from their wings. They lunged forward in unison, aiming to overwhelm him from every angle.</p>

<p>Asahi shifted his stance, letting the sword rest lightly in his hand. He tilted his head slightly and whispered under his breath.</p>

<p>Time to see if my training really pays off.</p>

<p>The headmaster’s eyes narrowed, anticipation flickering in them. This attack was far from her full power, yet she wanted to see how he handled multiple threats at once. This will show me exactly how much he’s grown.</p>

<p>Asahi’s smirk widened, his fingers tightening slightly on the hilt. The room filled with the pounding of wyvern wings and the distant echo of claws striking stone.</p>

<p>“Come on then,” he muttered, his voice barely above a whisper. “Let’s make this interesting.”</p>

<p>The headmaster’s lips curved into a faint, almost imperceptible smile. Good. He’s confident. That confidence might just carry him through the first strike… but the real test is coming.</p>

<p>The three wyverns roared in unison, claws extended, aiming directly at Asahi. They surged forward, talons slicing through the air with lethal precision.</p>

<p>Asahi’s eyes glowed, the augmentation sharpening every detail. He leapt into the air, sword raised, and with a single, powerful swing engulfed in fire, he beheaded all three wyverns at once. Their bodies fell in a shower of scales and sparks, the room echoing with the impact.</p>

<p>Their movements… they look agonizingly slow to me. Especially compared to that dastardly spider, he thought, recalling the trials that had honed his reflexes.</p>

<p>The headmaster’s face remained calm, composed, her stance steady, but inside her mind was a storm. How… how could he be this fast and precise? I thought only a handful of elite warriors could move like that. He’s handled three at once without breaking a sweat. How much training has he gone through?</p>

<p>“What kind of training did you undergo exactly?” she asked, her voice even, betraying almost none of her surprise.</p>

<p>Asahi landed lightly, fire still flickering along his blade. “My master made me fight them,” he said calmly. “Night stalkers, molten gorgons, packs of wyverns in the Fourth Layer… and for the final test, one-on-one against an obsidian widow. I beat it without much trouble.”</p>

<p>The headmaster blinked once, her hand tightening slightly on the hilt of her power, but her expression remained composed. So he didn’t just face monsters in isolation… he fought packs, layered trials, extreme dangers… and survived them all. He’s far beyond what I anticipated.</p>

<p>She gave a small, almost imperceptible nod, the corners of her lips tightening. “I see,” she said, calm and collected, though her mind raced to process his strength. This is more than skill or raw power. He’s endured everything to reach this level. He’s truly ready.</p>

<p>Asahi’s gaze met hers, steady and unwavering. All that practice was necessary. I can face anything now.</p>

<p>The headmaster studied him a moment longer, her composed exterior belying the awe and caution growing inside. Very well, Asahi. Let’s see how far your limits truly reach.</p>

<p>“The final part of your test,” she said, her voice steady, “is to survive the next attack.”</p>

<p>Asahi felt the air around him grow heavy, charged with an almost palpable malevolence. A chill ran down his spine, and the light of the duel room seemed to twist and darken. He blinked, and when his eyes opened again, the world around him had completely changed.</p>

<p>The duel room was gone. He now stood in a barren wasteland, cracked earth stretching endlessly in every direction. Tornadoes whipped across the horizon, volcanic eruptions cast rivers of molten rock into the sky, and lightning storms split the dark clouds above. The wind carried the smell of sulfur and ash.</p>

<p>This… this is hopeless, he thought, his chest tightening. There is no way anyone could survive this.</p>

<p>He stumbled, knees buckling under the weight of the overwhelming scene. But then, deep inside, a spark ignited. I have to get stronger. I have to surpass everything, everyone. This is nothing compared to what I have endured.</p>

<p>His hands shook as he grasped his sword. With a grimace, he drove the blade into his own leg, pain exploding through him, grounding him, sharpening his mind. The world around him flickered, and when he opened his eyes again, he was back in the duel room.</p>

<p>The headmaster’s eyes widened slightly, her composed mask momentarily faltering. His mental strength… it’s beyond what I expected.</p>

<p>She quickly recovered her composure, a small smile playing at her lips. Of course. A child who survived the Fourth Layer, fought packs of wyverns, and defeated an obsidian widow would have this kind of resolve.</p>

<p>“You have proven yourself, Asahi,” she said, her voice calm but warm. “You are now part of this school as a special student.”</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head slightly, blinking blankly. “A special student?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied. “A special student is someone who both learns and teaches. You will grow and, in turn, guide others.”</p>

<p>Asahi tilted his head slightly, blinking blankly. “I don’t think I heard you right,” he said, his voice quiet but firm.</p>

<p>The headmaster’s lips curved into a faint, blank smile as she met his gaze.</p>
