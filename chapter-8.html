<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 8 – OFF WE GO</div>

<p>Asahi packed up his small campsite near the stream, neatly sliding his clean sword into its hilt. His makeshift spear, reforged from the rusty sword and dagger, rested securely on his back, and the fire-scorched remnants of his boar-cooking setup were carefully extinguished. He wiped the last traces of soot from his hands and adjusted his new adventurer's attire.</p>

<p>The battle against the boars was about a week ago. I managed to get my efficiency up to about sixty percent.</p>

<p>I can now easily beat all the creatures in this area. Ten fire swings, thirty fire thrusts… I can throw them all without collapsing.</p>

<p>But this area isn't enough. I've grown stronger, sure, but staying here won't push me further.</p>

<p>He glanced back at the stream, at the trees that had been his haven for the past two months, at the little nook where he had rested, fished, and trained. Sweet, safe… this place kept me alive, gave me time to learn. But it's time to go.</p>

<p>"Alright… north it is. Deeper into the forest."</p>

<p>He slung the spear over his shoulder, tightened the strap on his sword, and took a deep breath. The path ahead was darker, more foreboding, and full of unknown dangers—but Asahi's eyes gleamed with determination. He stepped off the familiar trail and into the shadows of the trees.</p>

<p>Time to see how much stronger I really am.</p>

<div class="narrator">Beyond the safer, goblin-and-kobold-filled sections of the forest lies what could be called the third level, where only the bravest or most desperate adventurers dare tread. Here, monsters grow in size, cunning, and cruelty. One might find wolf packs with razor-sharp fangs, giant boars with tusks like spears, venomous snakes that can swallow a man whole, or towering trolls that wield trees as clubs. Flying predators circle the canopy, ready to snatch the unwary, while packs of aggressive, cunning lizardmen stalk the undergrowth. Magic-wielding beasts become more common, and traps set by monsters themselves or by wandering adventurers gone missing litter the terrain. A single misstep here can mean death, and even seasoned adventurers approach cautiously, often scouting in groups. It is a place where skill, cunning, and luck must all align, and where a careless strike or a wrong turn could be the end of one's journey.</div>

<p>Asahi weaved through the dense undergrowth with practiced ease, ducking under low-hanging branches and sliding past thorny bushes without a sound. His steps were light, barely disturbing the forest floor, and he moved with the precision of someone who had spent months honing his reflexes and agility.</p>

<p>No more slipping, no more shouting at gravity, he thought with a small grin, swinging across a sturdy branch and landing softly on the next without a single snap of a twig.</p>

<p>He paused at the edge of a small clearing, crouching behind a bush to survey the area. Several sets of glowing eyes reflected the dim light filtering through the canopy. Low growls rumbled in the distance.</p>

<p>These aren't kobolds or goblins…</p>

<p>Three massive dire wolves emerged from the shadows, their fur dark and matted, fangs bared, and claws digging into the soft earth. They circled slowly, moving with terrifying grace, noses twitching as they sniffed the air, clearly having locked onto him as prey.</p>

<p>"Alright… let's see if all this training was worth it," Asahi muttered under his breath, tightening his grip on his sword and shifting the spear on his back.</p>

<p>Time to test myself against something stronger than a boar or a kobold.</p>

<p>The wolves crouched, tails low, ears pinned back, growls deepening. The forest seemed to hold its breath as the standoff began.</p>

<p>Asahi crouched, muscles coiled like springs. Then, with a sudden burst, he leapt out from behind the bushes.</p>

<p>He thrust his stone-and-metal spear forward, chanting under his breath, Fire Thrust!</p>

<p>The spear shot like a bullet toward the dire wolf on his left, but with a terrifying snap of its jaws, the wolf caught it cleanly in its mouth. The force of the impact rattled Asahi's arms.</p>

<p>What?! That was supposed to hit!</p>

<p>Before he could react further, the other two wolves lunged from both sides, claws slashing through the underbrush. There was no time to retreat.</p>

<p>No way around this… wide range attack only.</p>

<p>"Fire Swing!" he shouted, swinging his sword in a broad, arcing motion. Sparks and flames traced the crescent of the blade as it cut through the air. Two wolves collided with the magical slash, yelping and screeching as flames licked their fur. He landed nimbly, rolling back a few steps, satisfaction blooming in his chest.</p>

<p>Yes… that worked perfectly. That was flawless.</p>

<p>But the satisfaction was short-lived. The surviving wolf that had caught his spear stepped forward, snarling, baring its fangs. Its fur bristled, and its eyes glowed a cruel, calculating red.</p>

<p>They're learning… they're getting cautious.</p>

<p>The remaining wolf lunged again, fangs snapping, claws raking across his armor. Asahi dodged and rolled, feeling sharp slashes tear across his arms and shoulders. Blood ran down his face, and one particularly hard swipe left a nasty gash across his side.</p>

<p>"Ugh… can't stop now… gotta keep moving!"</p>

<p>He slashed with precise fire swings, timing each crescent with sparks and flames, but the wolf was relentless, circling, waiting for an opening. One misstep and he felt the wolf's teeth just miss his arm.</p>

<p>Okay… this one's tough… I can't just blast him with magic or I'll be drained too fast.</p>

<p>The wolf lunged again, faster this time, and Asahi barely sidestepped, feeling the wind from its claws brushing past his face. A low, guttural growl shook the forest, accompanied by snapping twigs and rustling leaves.</p>

<p>"You think you can wear me down?!" he yelled, planting his feet and swinging a fire swing at the beast. Sparks flew off the wolf's fur as it twisted mid-air, dodging by inches.</p>

<p>I… I can't keep doing this… I need a plan… think, Asahi, think!</p>

<p>His eyes flicked to the spear lodged in the wolf's mouth. That was his chance. The wolf had it clamped on instinct, but it wouldn't hold forever.</p>

<p>Alright… I have to force it to let go, and then I go all in…</p>

<p>He feinted a swing to the left, then pivoted and drove his sword forward with a horizontal fire swing. Flames traced the arc, catching the wolf's shoulder. The wolf yelped and shook violently, releasing the spear.</p>

<p>"Finally!" Asahi muttered, lunging forward to retrieve it.</p>

<p>The wolf recovered instantly and pounced, claws slashing his side. Pain exploded across his ribs, and he stumbled back, spitting out blood.</p>

<p>"Argh! You little…!"</p>

<p>He rolled under the wolf's claws and managed to jab a quick, weak fire thrust into its flank. A hiss and a sizzling sound filled the air as the wolf leapt back, shaking its head in anger.</p>

<p>It's strong… stronger than anything I've faced alone. But I… I can't lose… not now… not after everything I've trained for.</p>

<p>He breathed heavily, tasting iron, muscles screaming, every joint protesting. The wolf circled him, snarling, each step making the earth tremble beneath its paws. Asahi noticed its eyes tracking his every movement, calculating.</p>

<p>I have to make my strikes count. Timing… precision… fire… sharp… not waste it…</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth, channeling his magic into the spear tip. Fire Thrust!</p>

<p>The spear shot forward like a glowing missile, narrowly avoiding the wolf's snapping jaws. Sparks sizzled as it grazed the wolf's shoulder. The beast yelped and leapt back. Asahi rolled, dodging another swipe that would have split his armor.</p>

<p>"C'mon… I can do this… I have to do this!"</p>

<p>He feinted left again, then spun and swung the spear horizontally in a full, fiery arc, sending a crescent of flames spinning across the wolf's path. The wolf was forced to leap back, avoiding the flames, and Asahi pushed himself to follow up with a fire thrust aimed directly at the wolf's chest. It collided with a sizzling crack, leaving a deep scorched line across the wolf's fur.</p>

<p>That… that actually hit… yes… one more strike and this is over…</p>

<p>The wolf hesitated, a fraction slower now. Asahi's heart pounded in his ears. Every breath burned, every muscle screamed. Blood ran freely down his face and arms.</p>

<p>"Fire Thrust!" he roared, lunging forward with the spear. This time he timed it perfectly, letting the magic slice like a thin blade at the exact moment of impact. The spear connected squarely between the wolf's eyes. A sizzling, frying noise filled the air as the flames scorched fur and muscle. The wolf let out a final, tortured howl before collapsing.</p>

<p>Asahi staggered back, dropping to one knee, chest heaving, body trembling from exhaustion. His sword and spear were both slick with blood, his vision blurred, but he was alive.</p>

<p>"I… I did it… I actually did it…"</p>

<p>He looked around the clearing. The other two wolves lay motionless, while the last had fallen in a spectacular display of fire, sparks, and blood. The forest was eerily silent except for his ragged breathing and the soft rustle of leaves in the wind.</p>

<p>This… this was insane. I'm barely standing… but I survived. I survived by a thread. And if I had been slower, or hesitated… I wouldn't be here.</p>

<p>Asahi wiped blood from his face with the back of his hand, tasting the iron. He looked down at the spear and sword in his hands, magic still faintly humming along their edges.</p>

<p>This… this is what real combat feels like… no more kobolds, no more boars… and I'm alive. I'm stronger… but I've never been this close to dying.</p>

<p>He let out a long breath and leaned against a tree, staring at the forest canopy. The adrenaline coursing through him was slowly ebbing, replaced by exhaustion and the weight of the danger he had just survived.</p>

<p>If this is what the forest has in store… then… there's no turning back. I have to get stronger. I have to learn how to survive… or next time… next time, I won't make it.</p>
