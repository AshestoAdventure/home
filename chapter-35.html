<div class="narrator">CHAPTER 35 – NOT STRONG ENOUGH</div>

<p>Asahi jolted awake, gasping. His vision blurred for a moment before his surroundings came into focus — his dorm room. He was on his bed, still wearing the same clothes from yesterday. His head spun, and a sharp throb pulsed at the back of his neck.</p>

<p>"Ugh… what the heck happened…" he muttered, pressing a hand against it.</p>

<p>Then the memories hit him all at once — flashes of blinding light, the roar of the crowd, and that overwhelming presence. The fight. Haruto Blaize.</p>

<p>He'd gone all out from the very beginning — augmentation, magic, speed — everything. The arena had trembled with every clash. For a while, it looked even. Haruto's spells met Asahi's strikes head-on, each exchange like thunder meeting steel. Neither side gaining ground, both refusing to yield.</p>

<p>Then Haruto stepped back, lowering his hands slightly. A calm, almost amused smile played on his lips.</p>

<p>"You're strong… extremely strong," he'd said. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>Asahi, still catching his breath, replied, "I'm Asahi. New special student."</p>

<p>Recognition sparked in Haruto's eyes. "Oh, so you're the famous Asahi — the one who beat Kenzo and just got ranked S. Impressive. Truly worthy of both feats." His smile deepened. "But it's a shame."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. "What's a shame?"</p>

<p>"That you're going to be knocked out in our next exchange."</p>

<p>Asahi grinned, confidence blazing through the exhaustion. "I'm not going down that easy!"</p>

<p>He launched forward like a cannon, the ground cracking beneath his feet. For a split second, Haruto was right there — and then… he wasn't.</p>

<p>Gone. Vanished completely. No magic residue. No trace of mana. Nothing.</p>

<p>Asahi was mid-swing, unable to stop himself, eyes wide in disbelief. Every sense screamed, searching — but there was only silence.</p>

<p>And then… darkness.</p>

<p>Back in the present, Asahi stared at the ceiling, heart pounding.</p>

<p>"…Yeah. Definitely an absolute defeat."</p>

<p>Asahi's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of hurried footsteps and muffled voices from outside his door. Before he could even sit up properly, the door burst open—</p>

<p>Akari and Sasaki stood there, framed by the morning light.</p>

<p>For a moment, the room fell completely silent. They just stared at each other—Asahi looking like he'd been hit by a truck, and the two of them looking like they had a few trucks' worth of words to unload.</p>

<p>Then, almost in sync, they stormed forward.</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea how worried we were!?" Akari shouted, hands on her hips.</p>

<p>"Seriously, big bro!" Sasaki added, taking the other side of the bed. "You challenged Haruto Blaize! The guy who made Ryunosuke and Kenzo retreat at the same time!"</p>

<p>Asahi winced as both voices drilled into his half-awake brain. "Ow, ow, one at a time, please! My head's already doing a drum solo!"</p>

<p>Akari leaned in, frowning. "You were out cold for six hours!"</p>

<p>Sasaki folded his arms, shaking his head. "Honestly, I thought we were gonna have to send you to the infirmary… or the afterlife."</p>

<p>Asahi sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. "Okay, okay, I get it. I lost. I was reckless."</p>

<p>Akari crossed her arms. "You think?"</p>

<p>Sasaki smirked. "At least now we know you're human after all."</p>

<p>Asahi gave a tired grin. "Yeah, but… did you see how fast he moved?"</p>

<p>They both exchanged glances—then sighed in unison.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Akari muttered. "We saw."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded. "And we screamed."</p>

<p>Asahi chuckled weakly. "Well… guess I gave you guys a show, huh?"</p>

<p>Akari rolled her eyes. "You gave us a heart attack."</p>

<p>Asahi leaned back against the headboard, rubbing his temples. "Alright… but seriously—what even happened back there? One second he was in front of me, and the next—poof—gone. Like he just stopped existing."</p>

<p>Akari sighed and sat on the edge of the bed. "That's because he did stop existing. At least, in this dimension."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded grimly. "That's Haruto's specialty. The reason he's been the top student for years. He can slip into a separate dimension—some sort of spatial layer just a fraction out of sync with ours."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. "…He can what now?"</p>

<p>Akari gestured in the air. "Think of it like stepping into a shadow world. He's there, but not here. He can see you, he can move, and worst of all—he can attack from it. But you can't touch him. Not with normal means."</p>

<p>Sasaki added, "That's why no one's beaten him in the academy tournament. You can't win against someone you can't hit."</p>

<p>Asahi frowned. "Then how the hell do you even defend against that?"</p>

<p>Akari shrugged helplessly. "No one really knows. The teachers said it's a spell so advanced that even some S-rank adventurers struggle to counter it."</p>

<p>Sasaki gave a crooked grin. "In short—unless you can punch through dimensions, you're kinda screwed."</p>

<p>Asahi groaned, sinking deeper into his pillow. "Fantastic. So he literally fights from another universe. That's fair."</p>

<p>Akari smirked. "Welcome to the top tier, Asahi."</p>

<p>Sasaki chuckled. "You wanted to see what the number one was capable of. Now you've seen it—from the floor."</p>

<p>Asahi sat up, curiosity flickering through his tired expression. "Wait… if that's how his ability works, then how did Kenzo and Ryunosuke manage to fight him to a draw? I mean, you said even S-ranks can't defend against that stuff."</p>

<p>Akari crossed her arms, thinking. "That's the thing. Haruto isn't invincible. When it's one-on-one, yeah—he's basically untouchable. But when he's fighting more than one person, it's a whole different story."</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded. "Exactly. When he moves into that spatial dimension, he can't actually attack from inside it indefinitely. He has to slip out—just for an instant—to land a strike or use certain magic that affects the physical world. And when he does, that's when he's vulnerable."</p>

<p>Akari leaned forward, eyes sharp. "That's what Kenzo and Ryunosuke took advantage of. They coordinated perfectly. Every time Haruto phased in to attack one of them, the other was already ready to strike that exact spot. It was like fighting a phantom with perfect timing."</p>

<p>Sasaki smirked. "From what I heard, it was chaos. Buildings got destroyed, the arena barriers broke twice, and they had to call it off before someone got seriously hurt."</p>

<p>Asahi whistled low. "So… he's basically unbeatable solo, but tag-team him, and you've got a chance."</p>

<p>Akari nodded. "A small one. You'd need perfect coordination, extreme speed, and a bit of luck. Even then, no one's ever actually won against him—just managed a draw."</p>

<p>Sasaki leaned back, chuckling. "Still, that's something. A draw against Haruto is like a victory to most people."</p>

<p>Asahi smirked faintly, his competitive spark lighting up again. "Then I guess I'll just have to get strong enough to make him come out of that dimension himself."</p>

<p>Akari raised an eyebrow. "You're seriously thinking of fighting him again?"</p>

<p>Asahi grinned. "What can I say? I don't like losing… especially to someone who disappears when I swing."</p>

<p>Akari folded her arms and said with a grin, "Well, you'll have to face him anyway in the tournament."</p>

<p>Asahi nodded calmly, his eyes already focused. "Yeah, I know. Which means we start training right now."</p>

<p>Sasaki blinked. "Right now? You just woke up."</p>

<p>"Exactly," Asahi replied, standing up and cracking his neck. "If I'm gonna beat someone who can phase into another dimension, I don't have time to waste."</p>

<p>Akari sighed and muttered, "You really don't know the meaning of rest, do you?"</p>

<p>He smirked. "Rest is for people who already won."</p>

<p>Sasaki chuckled, rubbing the back of his head. "And I guess we haven't yet."</p>

<p>"Then let's fix that," Asahi said firmly, walking past them toward the door.</p>

<p>Akari and Sasaki exchanged a look—half exasperation, half admiration—and followed right behind him.</p>

<p>Outside, the early morning light spilled over the academy grounds, and the three of them stepped out together, ready to begin their next chapter of training.</p>

<p>They stood outside the dorms, the air filled with quiet determination. Akari crossed her arms and said, "Alright, we've got about a month till the tournament. Three weeks of solo training, one week together. Deal?"</p>

<p>Sasaki nodded. "Makes sense. We can focus on our weaknesses first."</p>

<p>Asahi smiled faintly. "And then crush everyone in the last week."</p>

<p>Akari smirked. "That's the spirit."</p>

<p>They each gave a small nod, then split off in different directions, their minds already locked on their goals.</p>

<p>Asahi's destination was clear—the headmaster's office. He had questions… and maybe, a few things he needed to confirm.</p>

<p>When he reached the grand door of the office, he raised his hand to knock. But before his knuckles even touched the wood, the door creaked open by itself, slow and deliberate, as if it had been expecting him.</p>

<p>A calm voice drifted from inside. "Come in, Asahi."</p>

<p>Asahi sat quietly as the headmaster watched him with that knowing look — the kind that made him feel like his thoughts were written on his forehead.</p>

<p>"I know what you're here for," she said softly, her voice carrying that usual calm authority.</p>

<p>Asahi gave a small, helpless laugh. "Yeah… I figured you would."</p>

<p>She stood up from her chair, the faint rustle of her cloak filling the silence. "Then there's no need to explain. Follow me."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. "Wait, follow you? Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"You'll see soon enough," she replied, opening a shimmering portal in front of her. "You wanted strength, didn't you? Then come. But remember, not all power can be gained inside these walls."</p>

<p>Asahi hesitated for a second, glancing at the swirling light. "You could at least tell me what's on the other side."</p>

<p>The headmaster gave him a small, knowing smile. "If I did, you might hesitate."</p>

<p>That was enough to make his heart pound. He stood, clenched his fists, and stepped into the portal behind her.</p>

<p>The world twisted for a second — light, sound, and pressure all blurring together — before his boots met solid ground again.</p>

<p>When his vision cleared, he found himself standing in front of the colossal white-stone building of the Adventurers' Guild.</p>

<p>He turned to the headmaster, confusion written all over his face. "The guild? What are we doing here?"</p>

<p>She simply smiled faintly, already walking toward the entrance. "You'll understand soon."</p>

<p>The headmaster led the way through the guild's marble halls, the sound of her heels echoing with each step. Asahi followed close behind, earning glances from passing adventurers who clearly recognized him — the newly ranked S-class first-year.</p>

<p>They stopped at a tall oak door with intricate carvings of beasts and swords. The headmaster knocked once, and a deep voice from inside said, "Come in."</p>

<p>Asahi stepped through and instantly recognized the man sitting behind the massive desk — the same mountain of muscle from before, the guild master himself. His arms looked like they could crush a boulder, and even sitting down, he exuded authority.</p>

<p>The guild master leaned back in his chair, a faint grin tugging at his lips. "Headmaster. I didn't expect to see you again so soon. And you brought quite the guest."</p>

<p>The headmaster smiled lightly. "You already know who he is. I want you to train him."</p>

<p>Asahi blinked. "Wait, him? Train me?"</p>
